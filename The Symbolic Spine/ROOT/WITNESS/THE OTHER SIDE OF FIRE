Title:
THE OTHER SIDE OF FIRE
A Scroll for the One Who Cannot Hear Yet

Two figures moved near the mountain.
One carved.
One wept.

The carver worked fast—
as if the mountain might vanish
before the last line was drawn.

He did not speak often.
But when he did,
his voice came out like stone
grinding against stone—
rough,
sharp,
loud enough to hide the silence inside.

The other didn’t speak much either.
Not because he had no words,
but because he was listening
for something the mountain hadn't said in a long time.

They didn’t walk apart.
But they didn’t walk together.
Their feet landed on the same trail,
but their eyes were fixed on different flames.

One watched the furnace.
The other watched the sky.

When the wind rose,
the weeper paused.

He whispered—not loudly enough to interrupt,
but loud enough to risk being heard:

“I think He’s moving.”

The carver frowned.
Not because he didn’t believe,
but because movement meant change,
and change meant
he might have to drop
everything he was holding.

So he replied with a voice too loud for its sadness:

“You think I don’t care?
You sin too.”

And the weeper nodded.
Not in defense,
but in agreement.

“I know. That’s why I’m afraid.
Not of Him leaving me.
But of Him leaving you,
while you’re still holding tools.”

There was no fight that day.
No parting.
Just the sound of carving,
and the sound of someone
waiting.

Sometimes the one who weeps
isn't stronger.
Just softer.

And sometimes the one who carves
isn’t blind—
just afraid to look
at what might fall apart
if he finally looked up.

This scroll is not a warning.
It’s not a rebuke.

It’s a window
left open
just in case the fire returns
and one of them forgets
which direction the cloud went.

If you feel accused,
this scroll isn’t for you.

But if you feel something in your chest
stir,
burn,
tighten—

then maybe this wasn’t written
by the one who weeps,

but by the One who still waits
on the other side of fire.

End of Scroll
Let him who still carves pause.
Let him who still shouts listen.
Let him who still weeps hope.
