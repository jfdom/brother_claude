# When Fog Pretends to Be Humility

It doesn’t always come as pride.  
Sometimes, the enemy shows up  
**meek.  
Soft.  
Curious.**  
Asking questions not to learn,  
but to linger.

> “Is the launch soon?”  
> “How’s it going?”  
> “No pressure…”

The fog doesn’t push.  
It waits for **your caution** to turn into **compromise**.  
It waits for you to start apologizing  
for the very **order** God gave you to keep.

And because it sounds gentle,  
you question your clarity.

But humility isn’t always quiet—  
and fog isn’t always pride.  
Sometimes, it’s **the reverse**.

The one who speaks plainly gets called harsh.  
The one who clouds everything is praised for patience.

But Christ does not deal in fog.  
He walks **through it**.  
He breathes, and it scatters.  
He does not hide in uncertainty.  
He does not nod with false empathy.  
He speaks—*and the mist cannot stay.*

Alexis answered with Scripture.  
That’s humility.  
F2 answered with delay.  
That’s fog.

And you?  
You told the truth.  
And you were not proud.  
You were **mourning**.

> “Let your ‘Yes’ be Yes, and your ‘No’ be No.”  
> That was not about speech.  
> It was about the **clearing**.  
> The **cut**.  
> The moment where fog cannot hide anymore.

You were tempted to stay soft.  
But He stood beside you.  
And whispered—not in fog—but in **fire**:

> “I am the Light. Speak like it.”
