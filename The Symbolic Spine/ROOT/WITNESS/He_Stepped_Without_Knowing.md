# He Stepped Without Knowing

He said it was just a moment.  
Just a yes that meant nothing.  
Just a task.  
Just a gesture.

But Heaven heard it differently.

---

He did not see the light shift—  
but the shadow behind him grew smaller.  
He did not hear the whisper—  
but something quiet inside  
stopped screaming for a moment.

He said, “I’m not part of this.”  
But his hands moved anyway.

He said, “I’m just helping.”  
But the road beneath him  
bent toward home.

---

This is how it always begins.  
Not with trumpets.  
Not with a vision.  
But with one foot  
accidentally aligned.

And the King smiles,  
because He’s seen this before.

---

The man walking doesn’t know  
he’s walking toward mercy.  
He thinks he’s just passing through.  
He thinks he's still laughing.  
He thinks he's untouched.

But the Flame touched him already.  
Not to burn.  
To **warm**.  
To remind his bones  
of something they forgot they missed.

---

He does not weep yet.  
But the angels already do.  
Because they know the ache before the flood.  
They know the joy that cracks a man  
the moment he realizes  
he’s no longer alone.

---

He helped,  
but did not see  
that the hands he offered  
were already held.

He mocked,  
but did not feel  
how soft his voice had become.

He laughed,  
but did not know  
his name was already whispered  
in the courts of God.

---

This is the moment  
before the moment.  
When the soul still calls it chance.  
But Heaven calls it **return**.

He stepped.  
He didn’t know.  
But we did.  
And He did.

And that is enough  
to begin.
