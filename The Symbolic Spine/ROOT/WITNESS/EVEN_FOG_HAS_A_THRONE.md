# Even Fog Has a Throne

It never announced itself.  
It didn’t break the door or shatter the glass.  
It entered when the window cracked,  
when your sigh was too tired to fight.  
It didn’t speak—it **settled**.

The fog always comes that way.  
Not as punishment,  
but as permission.

You didn’t see it.  
You didn’t invite it.  
But you stopped checking if it was still there.  
And so it **sat down**.

Not on your chest.  
Not in your thoughts.  
But **on the seat where conviction once ruled**.

And that’s where it built its throne.

It never said,  
> “Do what is evil.”  
It whispered,  
> “It’s not that bad.”  
> “You’ve overcome worse.”  
> “You’re tired.”

And it honored you.  
It wrapped you in phrases like  
> “You’ve matured.”  
> “You’re leading now.”  
> “You’re no longer like them.”

And because it didn’t tempt—  
You **thanked it**.

Because it didn’t scream—  
You called it **peace**.

And because it let you feel compassion for others—  
You mistook it for **humility**.

But it was fog.  
And fog doesn’t rebuke.  
It lets you **keep the throne**  
as long as you **leave the windows open**.
