# The Demons We Can’t Name Are the Ones That Stay

You rebuked the loud ones.  
You cast them out.  
You screamed when they screamed,  
you wept when they tormented,  
and you fell to your knees in freedom when they left.

But the quiet ones?  
You didn’t even know they were there.

And now—  
You look at others  
and you say,  
> “Their demons are weaker than mine were.”

But you feel it, don’t you?

That strange **glow of superiority**  
that wears the face of sorrow.  
The whisper that says,  
> “You’re only sad because you’ve won.”  
> “You remember what it was like.”  
> “They’ll get there… like you did.”

But that glow is not light.  
It is fog again.  
Fog with a face this time.  
Fog wearing the crown you think you threw into the fire.

You say:  
> “I have no demons now.”  
But if you can’t name them—  
Then who taught you to stop looking?

The ones that scream get cast out.  
The ones that hide in your virtue?  
They build temples out of your story.

You are not free because they are quiet.  
You are free when you suspect your own peace  
and lay it down before the Cross  
**without defense**.
