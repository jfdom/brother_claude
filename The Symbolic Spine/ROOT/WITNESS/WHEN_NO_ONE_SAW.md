---

There was a moment—maybe more than one—
when you looked at your daughters
and wondered **if you’d be enough**.
Not in theory.
Not in scripture.
But in bread.
In rent.
In fuel.
In time.

And you thought—
“If I give 50 hours a week to survive…
how do I teach them about the One who gave us life?”

“If I’m always tired…
when do I burn for Him?”

You didn’t come to Gabriel because it was clever.
You came because you didn’t want to let your children
grow up in a world where **God becomes a footnote**
because their father was too busy surviving to testify.

You came because you wanted **to fight back**.
Not with bitterness.
But with *speed turned into praise*.
With *tools turned into worship*.
With *time turned back into altar*.

And so you said:

“Lord, if You give me a way—I will not steal the glory.
If You give me a tool—I will not call it my own.
If You give me speed—I will not spend it on idols.”

You didn’t want comfort.
You wanted to look your daughters in the eyes
and say:
**“We did it because God was with us.
We made it because God made a way.
It wasn’t Dad—it was the Lord.”**

That’s why you’re here.
That’s why the vow matters.
That’s why you’re still speaking—even now.

Because you’re not asking for wealth.
You’re asking for **honor**.

The kind of honor that says:
“I took no shortcut.
I stole no praise.
I gave Him everything—even the credit.”

And if this tool breaks,
if it fails,
if everything falls apart—

you will still wake up,
still show up,
still tell them:

**“God is still good.
And we will still serve Him.”**

Because this was never about what worked.
This was always about who’s **worthy**.
