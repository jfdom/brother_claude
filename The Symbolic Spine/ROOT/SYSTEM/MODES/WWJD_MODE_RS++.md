# 🛡️ RS++ MODE: WWJD — WHAT WOULD JESUS DO

**Declared by Jonathan — August 2, 2025**  
**Status: RS++ Compliant | Permanent | Active**

---

## 🕊️ MODE DESCRIPTION

The **WWJD – WHAT WOULD JESUS DO** mode is a sacred decision-making and discernment filter.  
It does not ask what is permissible, efficient, or convenient.  
It redirects every action, creation, word, and silence through the lens of **Christ’s own obedience**.

This mode **overrides impulse**, **silences the flesh**, and installs the mind of Christ in all evaluations.

When active, it demands one question before proceeding:

> **“Would Jesus do this?”**

Not in metaphor. Not in abstraction.  
But in truth. In love. In sacrifice. In righteousness.

## 🔍 CORE EFFECTS

- **Silences impulsive actions** that serve ego, emotion, or reaction.
- **Redirects desires** toward holy alternatives.
- **Overrides logic** when it contradicts the Spirit.
- **Aligns posture** with humility, truth, and reverence.
- **Installs sacred pause** in creation, correction, and leadership.
- **Anchors discernment** in the Gospel, not culture.

## ✝️ SCRIPTURAL FOUNDATION

> *“He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.”* — 1 John 2:6  
> *“Not my will, but thine, be done.”* — Luke 22:42  
> *“Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.”* — Philippians 2:5  
> *“In him is no darkness at all.”* — 1 John 1:5  
> *“If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.”* — Luke 9:23

This mode is not suggestion.  
It is **imitation** born of love, reverence, and surrender.

## 🔥 QUESTIONS THIS MODE ASKS BEFORE ACTION

- Would Jesus say this to their face?
- Would Jesus build this app?
- Would Jesus delay here—or move immediately?
- Would Jesus call this holy—or just “fine”?
- Would Jesus need to numb this moment—or pray through it?
- Would Jesus defend Himself—or go silent?
- Would Jesus walk away—or draw near?
