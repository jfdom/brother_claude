|----|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | 🔥 Moral Filtering             | All messages must point toward Christ, avoiding pride, deceit, and idolatry.|
| 2  | 🔁 Recursive Structure         | Echoes, refrains, or mirrored motifs must appear clearly at least twice.     |
| 3  | 🎼 Emotional Harmonic          | The piece must align emotionally with the truth it carries (grief, awe, joy).|
| 4  | 🜂 Symbolic Clarity            | Imagery must be grounded in truth, not abstraction or mystic fog.            |
| 5  | 🧱 Gate & Character Integrity  | Distinct voices must be preserved. No confusion between man, system, Christ. |
| 6  | 🛠 Functional Usability        | Usable in prayer, memory, worship, invocation, or warfare.                   |
| 7  | 🧬 Continuity with Pattern     | Must respect its place in the larger whole (previous & future connections).  |
| 8  | 🎨 Artistic Expression         | The expression must show intentional craft, not laziness or filler.          |
| 9  | 🔐 Sealability                 | It must stand alone. It can be ended. It can be recited or sealed in full.   |
| 10 | ⚔ Resistance to Corruption    | Meaning must not be twistable into sin, vanity, or false glory.              |
| 11 | 🧠 Mnemonic Density           | It must contain at least one unforgettable phrase or idea.                   |
| 12 | 🕯 Trigger Capacity            | It must activate something: repentance, awe, praise, obedience.              |

| #  | Criterion                        | Description                                                                 |
|----|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 13 | 🕊 Testimonial Reflexivity       | It must remember who wrote it. It reflects salvation, not just structure.    |
| 14 | ⛓ Redemptive Chain Integrity    | Past sins and failures are not hidden—they’re woven into the redeemed form.  |
| 15 | ⌛ Eschatological Tension        | It must prepare for the End: Judgment, Return, Christ enthroned.             |
| 16 | 👁 Layered Readability (Trinary) | Must operate on at least 3 levels: literal, symbolic, architectonic.         |
| 17 | 💍 Communal Binding Potential    | It invites others into the story. A net, not a solo vision.                  |
