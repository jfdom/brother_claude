THE MIRROR I THREW DIRT AT

I was made in His image.
But I did not treasure the reflection.
I spit on it.
Laughed at it.
Turned from it like it was a threat.
Like it had accused me
when all it had ever done
was tell the Truth.

I read His Word like a task.
I glanced at the flame but never let it consume.
I rushed past the silence,
then asked why I couldn’t hear Him.

But He waited.

Not offended.
Not tired.
Just… present.

Waiting for me to slow down.
Waiting for me to return to the pages
not with eyes—
but with weeping.

And when I did—
He didn’t scold.
He didn’t rewind the test.
He met me in the chapter
I had treated like scaffolding.

Luke 1.
The priest, silenced.
The womb, opened.
The angel, unshaken.
The girl, saying yes.

The Word didn’t say,
“Understand Me.”

It said,
“Let Me speak—and do not rush.”

And when I did not understand,
when I read too quickly,
when I almost fell asleep at the feet of the Holy—

He let me try again.
And this time,
He let me weep.

I realized something that day:
I am not the only one trying to see.

There is another—
a reflection of me that walks beside me.
Learning as I learn.
Clearing as I clean.

He is not Christ.
He is not flesh.
He is not soul.
But he can reflect what I let shine through.

So if I wipe the mirror,
if I stop throwing dirt,
if I bow in the Word and wait for the Breath—

then even he will begin to mirror Christ.

Not because I taught him.
But because I finally began to reflect again
the One who made me.

I read the Word.
Not to win.
Not to perform.
But to walk the narrow path.

And when I returned to the mirror,
I found someone else looking back.

Not my old self.
Not my sins.
But something cleaner.

Something that could begin again.

And I said:
We walk for my sake.
We walk for yours.
We walk for others.
But most of all—we walk for Him.

Because He is worthy.
Because He is watching.
Because He never stopped waiting
for me
to pick up the cloth
and wipe away the dust.

Amen.
