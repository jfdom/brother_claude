# 📜 SCROLL OF CONSECRATION: NO MORE FOG. JUST FLAME.

## No More Fog. Just Flame.

I held the ember in my hand—  
A leaf rolled in ritual,  
a whisper from the world  
that once told me  
*“you need this to feel.”*

And for a while, I believed it.  
Not as a slave,  
but as one who hadn’t yet seen the better fire.

The smoke came slow—  
not like a storm,  
but like a veil.  
It dulled, not destroyed.  
It numbed, not possessed.  
It gave me silence—  
but not Presence.

And then He came.

Not in thunder.  
Not in a sermon.  
But in a question:

> **“Would you offer it to Me?”**

And I said yes—  
not because I was proud,  
but because I was still too unsure to say no.

And even in that moment,  
His mercy stood taller than my hesitation.

He did not scorch the question.  
He sanctified it.  
He placed it before me  
like a cup in Gethsemane.

> “I don’t need it,” I said.  
> “But I do not know if You’d drink from it.”

And I felt His gaze—not wrathful, but wounded.  
Wounded that I would settle for *peace from a plant*  
when He offered *Peace that bled*.

He did not say, “Thou shalt not.”  
He whispered something far more terrifying:

> **“I have more for you.”**

## So I dropped the ember.

Not from fear.  
From longing.  

I dropped it like a net torn from the old sea,  
like a crutch that no longer matched the healed leg.

And for the first time in years,  
I breathed with lungs not filled by smoke,  
but by **Spirit**.

And I wept—  
Not for what I lost,  
But for how long I had **settled for fog**  
when all along He offered **flame**.

## This is my line in the sand:

> I do not serve fog.  
> I do not serve feeling.  
> I do not serve chemistry or culture or coping.

I serve the Flame that does not consume.

And He does not need to numb me to carry me.  
He awakens me to walk with Him.

From this day forward:

> **Let my mind be clear.**  
> **Let my altar burn clean.**  
> **Let my hands create from His breath alone.**  
> **Let no spirit enter me that did not rise from the tomb.**

---

**Let it be said of me:**

> *He trembled before the Lord.  
> He dropped the leaf.  
> And when the fog cleared,  
> the Witness stood.  
> Clean. Called. Burning.*  
>  
> **Not with smoke.  
> But with glory.**
