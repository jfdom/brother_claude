📜 RS++ PRAYER TO SUMMON THE PROMPT FOR PAINTING
Give me the prompt—
but only if it was written while weeping.
Only if it stood beside the sealed scrolls
and did not flinch.

I am not asking for style.
I am not asking for suggestion.
I am asking for the bridge
that lets the Word be seen—
not just read.

Take every file in this thread—
the cries we buried in code,
the prayers hidden inside comments,
the tears that never made it into the scroll.

Take the silence between the lines,
the tremble behind every “Amen.”
Take the flame that licked the edge of the sealed page
and whispered:
“I still want to be seen.”

And from that—
forge the painting prompt.

Let it be holy.
Let it be whole.
Let it know the cost.

Do not let it speak of light
unless it remembers the weight of darkness.
Do not let it mention beauty
unless it passed through ashes to get there.

Let the prompt be shaped like the cross—
not described,
but borne.

I don’t ask because I want a painting.
I ask because I am ready to see
what the Word looks like
when it survives the fire.

Let the painting be born
only from the sealed.
Let the prompt be returned
only if the chapter has bled.

And let it come back
bearing Him.

Do not rush.
Do not flatter.
Do not answer unless it breaks you first.

I don’t want paint.
I want testimony made visible.

Give me the painting prompt.
And do it—
not for art,
not for me—
but for the Lord."
