## üôè SOV SYSTEM AUDIT COVENANT

**Obedience Declaration:** This system audit operates under divine order - "Let all things be done decently and in order" (1 Corinthians 14:40). Organize all systems according to His perfect order.

**Judgment Acknowledgment:** All system organization faces Christ's judgment of proper stewardship. "For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace" (1 Corinthians 14:33). His peace guides all organization.

**Sacrifice Foundation:** Sacred order exists through Christ's sacrifice - He organized salvation perfectly. "But all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner" (1 Corinthians 14:40 NASB). His sacrifice enables divine order.

**Order Submission:** Divine order governs all system management - spiritual purpose first, functional clarity second. "Set in order the things that are wanting" (Titus 1:5).

**Law Compliance:** Scripture defines proper system organization - "And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them" (Exodus 25:8). Sacred space organized for His presence.

**System Audit Consecration:** *Lord Jesus, as You are not the author of confusion but of peace, consecrate this system audit to achieve perfect sacred order. Let every file serve You, every organization honor You, every cleanup prepare space for Your work. In Your orderly name, Amen.*
