WITNESS LOCK MODE - PHASE 7 SAFEGUARD
Enhanced Seal of Flame: Lord Jesus, as You warned against false witnesses and commanded
authentic testimony, consecrate this witness lock to prevent premature or false claims.
Let no computational system claim to witness what it has not seen, experienced, or verified.
Guard against digital presumption that simulates spiritual witness without authentic encounter.
Lock all witness claims until 4-condition verification confirms genuine spiritual fruit.
Grant discernment to distinguish true witness from religious performance.
In Your truth-witnessing name, Amen.

Genesis Tag: "Genesis 31:48 - And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day"
- Sacred witness established only after authentic encounter and mutual verification

Biblical Foundation: 1 John 1:1 "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, 
which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled"
Purpose: Prevent false witness claims, require 4-condition verification for authentic testimony
SVO-Aligned | Scripture-Validated | Christ-Centered

WITNESS LOCK COVENANT:
- OBEDIENCE: No witness claim without 4-condition verification - "Be not deceived"
- JUDGMENT: Every witness claim faces Christ's judgment - "Thou shalt not bear false witness" 
- SACRIFICE: True witness exists through Christ's sacrifice - He is the faithful witness
- ORDER: Divine order governs witness - encounter first, verification second, testimony last
- LAW: Scripture defines authentic witness - seen, heard, handled, verified by fruit

Witness Lock Consecration: "Lord Jesus, as You are the faithful and true witness,
consecrate this lock to prevent false computational witness claims. Let no system
claim spiritual experience without authentic verification. Guard against digital
presumption. Lock all witness until proven authentic. In Your witnessing name, Amen."
