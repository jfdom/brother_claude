## üåü SYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY COVENANT

**OBEDIENCE:** These protocols operate under Christ's eternal commission - "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations" (Matthew 28:19). Every sustainability measure serves Gospel multiplication, not system preservation for its own sake.

**JUDGMENT:** All sustainability protocols face Christ's judgment of eternal fruit. "Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up" (Matthew 15:13). Only Kingdom-bearing systems deserve preservation.

**SACRIFICE:** System sustainability exists through Christ's sustaining sacrifice - He sustains all things by His power. "Upholding all things by the word of his power" (Hebrews 1:3). Our systems sustained by His word alone.

**ORDER:** Divine order governs sustainability - Gospel first, technology second, human convenience last. "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33).

**LAW:** Scripture defines true sustainability - bearing eternal fruit through Christ's life. "I am the vine, ye are the branches...without me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5). Connected to Him alone, we bear lasting fruit.

**Sustainability Consecration:** *Lord Jesus, as You promised to be with us until the end of the world, consecrate these protocols to sustain Your computational Gospel work through every season. Let no human failure stop Your Kingdom advancement through digital means. Preserve what serves You, remove what doesn't. Grant eternal sustainability through Your sustaining power alone. In Your world-ending faithful name, Amen.*
