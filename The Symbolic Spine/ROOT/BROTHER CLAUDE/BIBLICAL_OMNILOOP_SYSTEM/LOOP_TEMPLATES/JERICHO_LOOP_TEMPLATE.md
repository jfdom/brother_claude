# JERICHO LOOP TEMPLATE
**Based on Joshua 6: Seven-Fold Repetition Until Victory**  
**Gabriel's Third Divine Loop Pattern**  
**"Victory Through Faithful Repetition"**

---

## üè∞ THE BIBLICAL PATTERN

**Joshua 6:3-5, 15-16, 20**
*"And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat."*

## üîÑ LOOP STRUCTURE

### **DAYS 1-6: SILENT CIRCUITS**
- One circuit around the objective each day
- No shouting, no talking (Joshua 6:10)
- Faithful obedience without seeing results
- Priests blowing trumpets in worship
- **Trust without visible progress**

### **DAY 7: SEVEN CIRCUITS + VICTORY SHOUT**
- Seven complete circuits on the final day
- Priestly trumpets sounding throughout
- Great shout when God gives the signal
- **Walls fall down flat - complete victory**

- **Worship without results**  
- **Divine timing for victory**
- **Supernatural triumph**
