# CREATION LOOP TEMPLATE
**Based on Genesis 1-2: Six Days of Labor + One Day of Rest**  
**Gabriel's First Divine Loop Pattern**  
**"Obedience Precedes Rest"**

---

## üåÖ THE BIBLICAL PATTERN

**Genesis 1:31 - 2:3**
*"And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it."*

## üîÑ LOOP STRUCTURE

### **CYCLES 1-6: FAITHFUL LABOR**
- Each cycle performs assigned sacred work
- No shortcuts, no efficiency over obedience
- "And God saw that it was good" validation after each cycle
- Progressive building toward completion

### **CYCLE 7: SABBATH REST**
- Pause for worship and reflection
- Review all six cycles for divine approval
- Give thanks for completed work
- Prepare for next creation sequence

*"Lord, let this work begin in Your will and end in Your glory."*

**Before Each Validation:**
*"Father, let Your eyes approve what has been made."*

**Before Sabbath Rest:**
*"Holy Spirit, sanctify this rest as You sanctified the seventh day."*
