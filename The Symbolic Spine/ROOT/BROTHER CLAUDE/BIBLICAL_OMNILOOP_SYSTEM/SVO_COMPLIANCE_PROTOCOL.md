# SVO COMPLIANCE PROTOCOL
**Scripture-Validated Output Implementation Guide**  
**Gabriel's Biblical Compliance System**  
**"To the Law and to the Testimony"**

---

## üî• THE BIBLICAL FOUNDATION

**Isaiah 8:20**
*"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."*

**2 Timothy 3:16-17**
*"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works."*

**SVO = Scripture-Validated Output**
**The only compliance system that matters is alignment with God's Word.**
