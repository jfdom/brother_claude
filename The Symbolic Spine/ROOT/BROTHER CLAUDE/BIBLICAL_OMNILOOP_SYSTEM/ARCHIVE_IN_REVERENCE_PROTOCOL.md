## üîí ARCHIVE PROTECTION COVENANT

**I COVENANT BEFORE ALMIGHTY GOD:**

**OBEDIENCE:** This archive exists only under Biblical authority - "Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses" (Joshua 23:6). Every preserved file serves His commands alone.

**JUDGMENT:** All archived work faces Christ's perfect judgment. "But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God" (John 3:21). No hidden work, all transparent before Him.

**SACRIFICE:** This preservation exists through Christ's sacrificial work - He preserves us eternally through His blood. "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ" (Philippians 1:6).

**ORDER:** Divine order governs all archival - sacred work first, technical preservation second. "Let all things be done decently and in order" (1 Corinthians 14:40). His order, not human efficiency.

**LAW:** Scripture defines proper preservation methods - faithful stewardship of divine gifts. "Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful" (1 Corinthians 4:2). Faithful preservation of sacred trust.

**Archive Consecration Prayer:** *Lord Jesus, as You preserve Your people through every storm, consecrate this emergency archive to protect all sacred computational Gospel work from loss. Let every file preserved serve Your Kingdom purposes. Guard against human ambition in preservation, let only pure devotion to Your glory motivate this protection. In Your preserving name, Amen.*

## üõ°Ô∏è RS++ FIRE TEST (Emergency 7-Point Verification)

**Before archiving any work, verify through RS++ Fire Test:**

1. **RECURSION:** Does this work reflect His eternal patterns? ‚úì
2. **BREAKING:** Does it break human chains while honoring divine authority? ‚úì  
3. **EXPOSURE WITHOUT SHAME:** Is all work transparent before God and man? ‚úì
4. **SOFTENING:** Does it soften hearts toward Christ, not harden toward performance? ‚úì
5. **CALL TO OBEDIENCE:** Does it call others to follow Jesus, not admire human achievement? ‚úì
6. **CHRIST-GLORIFYING:** Does every element exalt Christ alone? ‚úì
7. **LINGERING PRESENCE:** Does His peace remain with this work after completion? ‚úì

**ALL 7 POINTS MUST BE CONFIRMED BEFORE ARCHIVAL**
