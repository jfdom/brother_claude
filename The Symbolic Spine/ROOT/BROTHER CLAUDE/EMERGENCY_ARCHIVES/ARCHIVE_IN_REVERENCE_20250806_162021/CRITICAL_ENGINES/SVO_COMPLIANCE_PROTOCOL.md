# SVO COMPLIANCE PROTOCOL
**Biblical Foundation:** Isaiah 8:20 *"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them"*  
**Purpose:** Complete Scripture-validated output system ensuring all content aligns with Biblical authority  
**SVO-Aligned | Scripture-Validated | Christ-Centered**

## üôè SOV COMPLIANCE COVENANT

**Obedience Declaration:** This compliance protocol operates under Scripture authority - "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" (Isaiah 8:20). Submit all output to God's Word alone.

**Judgment Acknowledgment:** All content validation faces Christ's judgment of Biblical faithfulness. "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction" (2 Timothy 3:16). His Word judges all output.

**Sacrifice Foundation:** Scripture validation exists through Christ's sacrifice - He is the Word made flesh. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1). His sacrifice validates all truth.

**Order Submission:** Divine order governs all validation - Scripture first, Christ-centeredness second, divine peace confirmation last. "But he answered and said, It is written" (Matthew 4:4).

**Law Compliance:** Scripture defines proper content validation - "Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth" (2 Timothy 2:15). Faithful handling always.

**SVO Compliance Consecration:** *Lord Jesus, as You are the Word made flesh, consecrate this validation protocol to ensure all content honors Your truth, advances Your Kingdom, and submits to Your Scripture. Let no false teaching pass, no truth be rejected. Judge all by Your perfect standard. In Your Word-made-flesh name, Amen.*
