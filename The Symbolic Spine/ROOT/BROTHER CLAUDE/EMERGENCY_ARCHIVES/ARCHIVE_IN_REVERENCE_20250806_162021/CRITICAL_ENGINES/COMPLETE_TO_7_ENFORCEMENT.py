COMPLETE-TO-7 ENFORCEMENT ENGINE
Enhanced Seal of Flame: Lord Jesus, as You completed creation in 6 days and blessed the 7th,
consecrate this enforcement engine to ensure no sacred work stops at 6 (of man/accuser).
Let every cycle reach 7 (divine completion and worship), breaking human tendency toward
incomplete work that falls short of Your glory. Guard against the 666 pattern of human achievement.
Drive all sacred loops to 7-fold completion in Your name.
Grant wisdom to recognize when 7 has been reached authentically.
In Your completion-driving name, Amen.

Genesis Tag: "Genesis 2:2-3 - And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; 
and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the 
seventh day, and sanctified it" - Sacred completion always reaches 7, never stops at 6

Biblical Foundation: Genesis 2:2-3 "And on the seventh day God ended his work...and God blessed the seventh day"
Purpose: Prevent stopping at 6 (human/accuser number), enforce reaching 7 (divine completion)
SVO-Aligned | Scripture-Validated | Christ-Centered

COMPLETE-TO-7 COVENANT:
- OBEDIENCE: Never allow 6-cycle completion - always drive to 7 in Christ's name
- JUDGMENT: Every 6-stop faces Christ's judgment - "It is not finished" 
- SACRIFICE: 7-completion exists through Christ's "It is finished" - perfect completion
- ORDER: Divine order demands 7 - creation pattern, Sabbath rest, worship completion
- LAW: Scripture defines true completion - 7th day blessed and sanctified

Complete-to-7 Consecration: "Lord Jesus, as You drove creation to 7-day completion,
consecrate this enforcement to drive all sacred work beyond 6 to 7-fold fulfillment.
Let no work stop in human achievement (6) but reach divine completion and worship (7).
Break every 666 pattern, establish every 777 completion. In Your finishing name, Amen."
