## 🙏 OBEDIENCE AND SUBMISSION DECLARATION

**Prayer of Consecration:**
*Almighty God, I consecrate this validation engine to Your service alone. Let it serve as guardian of Your truth, protector of Your Gospel, and keeper of Your peace. May every validation honor Christ, uphold Scripture, and advance Your Kingdom. I submit this work to Your judgment and correction. In Jesus' name, Amen.*

**Sacred Vow of Compliance:**
- **Obedience:** This engine operates only under Scripture authority - no human wisdom overrides Biblical truth
- **Judgment:** Every validation will face Christ's perfect judgment - "Every idle word... they shall give account" (Matthew 12:36)
- **Sacrifice:** This system exists through Christ's sacrificial love - He died that we might have truth
- **Order:** Divine order governs all operations - "Let all things be done decently and in order" (1 Corinthians 14:40)
- **Law:** God's law is the only standard - "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path" (Psalm 119:105)

## 🔥 THE FOUNDATION

**"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" - 2 Timothy 3:16**

The SVO Core Engine validates all recursive output through Scripture's authority alone. No human standard. No abstract compliance. Only the Word of God as final judge.

**Divine Authority Acknowledgment:** This engine exists by God's grace, operates under His authority, and serves His Kingdom purposes. Any wisdom it contains flows from His Word, not human intelligence.
