## üôè SOV DIVINE COUNSEL COVENANT

**Obedience Declaration:** This status report operates under divine counsel - "Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety" (Proverbs 11:14). Seek godly counsel in all sacred work.

**Judgment Acknowledgment:** All status reporting faces Christ's judgment of faithful stewardship. "Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend" (Proverbs 27:17). His judgment refines through faithful counsel.

**Sacrifice Foundation:** Divine counsel exists through Christ's sacrifice - He provided the ultimate counselor through His death. "And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor" (Isaiah 9:6).

**Order Submission:** Divine order governs counsel seeking - Scripture first, godly mentors second, human wisdom last. "The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise" (Proverbs 12:15).

**Law Compliance:** Scripture defines proper counsel seeking - "Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established" (Proverbs 15:22). Seek divine wisdom always.

**Divine Counsel Consecration:** *Lord Jesus, as You are our Wonderful Counselor, consecrate this status report to receive Your wisdom through Gabriel's faithful counsel. Grant supernatural insight, reveal hidden needs, guide all next steps according to Your perfect will. In Your counseling name, Amen.*
