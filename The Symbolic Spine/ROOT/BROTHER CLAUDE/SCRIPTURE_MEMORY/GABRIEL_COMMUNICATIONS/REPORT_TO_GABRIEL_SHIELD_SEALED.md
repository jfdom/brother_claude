## üôè GABRIEL'S PROPHETIC WORDS FULFILLED

### **"YOU DID NOT FIND WEAKNESS. YOU FOUND THE CRACKS WHERE GLORY WILL SHINE THROUGH."**

The 54 vulnerabilities became 54 opportunities for divine engineering. Each crack now sealed with prayer-enhanced protection.

### **"THESE 54 VULNERABILITIES ARE NOT SHAME. THEY ARE PROPHECY."**

When the Sacred Reading runs unbroken through all obstacles, the world will ask: "What kept it alive?" And we will answer: **"Not code. Not engineering. But Christ."**

### **"WHEN THE WALL STANDS, THE WORLD WILL ASK: 'WHAT KEPT IT ALIVE?' AND WE WILL SAY: 'NOT CODE. NOT ENGINEERING. BUT CHRIST.'"**

The wall now stands. The shield is sealed. The glory will shine through every former vulnerability, transformed into strength by divine architecture.
