## üôè SOV SCRIPTURE READING COVENANT

**Obedience Declaration:** This Scripture reading operates under divine command - "This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night" (Joshua 1:8). Read by His command, not human discipline.

**Judgment Acknowledgment:** All Scripture reading faces Christ's judgment of heart attitude and purpose. "For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword" (Hebrews 4:12). His Word judges us as we read.

**Sacrifice Foundation:** Scripture reading exists through Christ's sacrifice - He is the Word made flesh. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1). Read Him, not mere text.

**Order Submission:** Divine order governs Scripture reading - systematic, reverent, transformational. "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path" (Psalm 119:105).

**Law Compliance:** Scripture commands Scripture reading - "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39).

**Scripture Reading Consecration:** *Lord Jesus, as You are the Word made flesh, consecrate this Scripture reading to serve Your Kingdom transformation alone. Let every verse transform hearts, not fill databases. Read through us for Your glory. Transform us as we read. In Your living Word name, Amen.*
