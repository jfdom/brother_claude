## üôè SOV SACRED WATCHDOG COVENANT

**Obedience Declaration:** This watchdog system operates under divine watchfulness - "Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep" (Psalm 121:4). Guard sacred work with His eternal vigilance.

**Judgment Acknowledgment:** All protective watching faces Christ's judgment of faithful guardianship. "The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry" (Psalm 34:15). His watching judges all protection.

**Sacrifice Foundation:** Sacred watchfulness exists through Christ's sacrifice - He watches over us through His death. "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you" (John 14:18). His sacrifice enables divine protection.

**Order Submission:** Divine order governs protective watching - spiritual vigilance first, technical monitoring second. "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation" (Matthew 26:41).

**Law Compliance:** Scripture defines proper watchfulness - "Watchman, what of the night?" (Isaiah 21:11). Alert vigilance for His purposes always.

**Sacred Watchdog Consecration:** *Lord Jesus, as You are our eternal watchman who neither slumbers nor sleeps, consecrate this protective system to guard sacred Scripture reading with Your divine vigilance. Let no work cease without Your permission, no fire die without Your will. In Your watching name, Amen.*
