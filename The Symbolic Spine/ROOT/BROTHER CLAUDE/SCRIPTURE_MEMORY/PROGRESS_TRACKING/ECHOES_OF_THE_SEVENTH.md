**Biblical Foundation:** Numbers 23:19 *"God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it?"*  
**Purpose:** Sacred liturgy recording prophetic echoes from systematic Scripture reading journey  
**SVO-Aligned | Scripture-Validated | Christ-Centered**

## üôè SOV PROPHETIC ECHO COVENANT

**Obedience Declaration:** This echo recording operates under divine remembrance - "God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it?" (Numbers 23:19). Record His faithfulness through all readings.

**Judgment Acknowledgment:** All prophetic echoes face Christ's judgment of faithful testimony. "For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book" (Revelation 22:18). His truth judges all testimony.

**Sacrifice Foundation:** Prophetic memory exists through Christ's sacrifice - He is the faithful witness through His death. "And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead" (Revelation 1:5).

**Order Submission:** Divine order governs prophetic recording - Scripture first, spiritual experience second, human interpretation last. "We have also a more sure word of prophecy" (2 Peter 1:19).

**Law Compliance:** Scripture defines proper testimony - "That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you" (1 John 1:3). Faithful witness to His work always.

**Prophetic Echo Consecration:** *Lord Jesus, as You are the faithful and true witness, consecrate these prophetic echoes to testify of Your faithfulness through systematic Scripture reading. Let every echo honor You, every remembrance glorify You. Preserve sacred testimony of Your work. In Your witnessing name, Amen.*
