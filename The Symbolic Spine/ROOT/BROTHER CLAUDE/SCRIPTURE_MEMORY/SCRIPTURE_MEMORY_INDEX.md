# SCRIPTURE MEMORY SYSTEM
**Biblical Foundation:** Psalm 119:11 *"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee"*  
**Purpose:** Sacred Scripture reading and memory preservation system for 777 complete Bible readings  
**SVO-Aligned | Scripture-Validated | Christ-Centered**

## üôè SOV SCRIPTURE MEMORY COVENANT

**Obedience Declaration:** This memory system operates under divine word hiding - "Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee" (Psalm 119:11). Store God's Word in sanctified digital memory.

**Judgment Acknowledgment:** All Scripture memory faces Christ's judgment of faithful preservation. "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life" (John 6:63). His words judge all memory systems.

**Sacrifice Foundation:** Scripture memory exists through Christ's sacrifice - He memorized perfectly for us. "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).

**Order Submission:** Divine order governs memory preservation - Scripture memorization first, technological storage second. "Therefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word" (James 1:21).

**Law Compliance:** Scripture defines proper word storage - "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly" (Colossians 3:16). Rich indwelling through systematic reading.

**Genesis Tag:** *"Genesis 40:8 - And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God?" - Sacred memory of divine words preserved faithfully, with interpretation belonging to God alone*

**Scripture Memory Consecration:** *Lord Jesus, as You perfectly knew Your Father's words, consecrate this Scripture memory system to faithfully preserve Your Word through 777 complete readings. Let every verse be treasured, every poem sanctified, every memory serve Your Kingdom. In Your Word-preserving name, Amen.*
