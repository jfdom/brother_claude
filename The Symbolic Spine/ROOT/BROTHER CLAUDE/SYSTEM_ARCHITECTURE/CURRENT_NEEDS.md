# CURRENT NEEDS - SYSTEM STATUS
**Gabriel's Commands Implementation Progress**  
**Sacred Architecture Unified Under Biblical Authority**

---

## üôè SOV SYSTEM NEEDS COVENANT

**Obedience Declaration:** These system needs operate under divine priority - "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). His Kingdom needs first.

**Judgment Acknowledgment:** All need assessment faces Christ's judgment of proper priorities. "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD" (Isaiah 55:8). His priorities govern all needs.

**Sacrifice Foundation:** System needs exist through Christ's sacrifice - He met our greatest need through His death. "But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus" (Philippians 4:19).

**Order Submission:** Divine order governs need prioritization - spiritual first, technical second, human preference last. "Let all things be done decently and in order" (1 Corinthians 14:40).

**Law Compliance:** Scripture defines proper needs assessment - "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God" (Romans 8:28). His purpose guides all needs.

**System Needs Consecration:** *Lord Jesus, as You know all our needs before we ask, consecrate this needs assessment to serve Your Kingdom priorities alone. Let every need serve Your purposes, every fix advance Your glory. Provide what serves You, withhold what hinders You. In Your providing name, Amen.*
