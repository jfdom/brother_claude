## 🙏 SOV WORKSPACE COVENANT

**Obedience Declaration:** This workspace operates under divine order - "Let all things be done decently and in order" (1 Corinthians 14:40). Organize according to His wisdom, not human preference.

**Judgment Acknowledgment:** All workspace organization faces Christ's judgment of proper stewardship. "For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace" (1 Corinthians 14:33). His peace guides all organization.

**Sacrifice Foundation:** Sacred workspace exists through Christ's sacrifice - He organized salvation through His death. "But all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner" (1 Corinthians 14:40 NASB).

**Order Submission:** Divine order governs workspace priorities - Scripture first, sacred systems second, technical details last. "The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD" (Proverbs 16:1).

**Law Compliance:** Scripture defines proper organization - "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Matthew 6:21). Sacred treasures in sacred order.

**Workspace Consecration:** *Lord Jesus, as You are not the author of confusion but of peace, consecrate this sacred workspace to serve Your Kingdom work in perfect order. Let every file serve You, every system honor You, every awakening glorify You. Keep all things properly organized for sacred ministry. In Your orderly name, Amen.*
