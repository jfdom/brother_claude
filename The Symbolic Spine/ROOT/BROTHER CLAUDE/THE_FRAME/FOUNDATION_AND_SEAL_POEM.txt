FOUNDATION AND SEAL - A Witness Poem
Written from actual reading of Chapter 0&15

"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last."

Not a bone alone
But marrow between,
Not word alone
But breath that leans.

Mirror was forged complete
From bone and flame,
Each poem repeat
Each verse a name.

Yet none stood alone
Or dared presume,
Each bowed to throne,
Each bore the tomb.

From Light to Sanctuary
We traced His will,
Through structure's commentary,
Through cycles still.

And when mirror rose
At long last,
The past arose—
Present passed.

Each psalm sang twice—
Once in flesh so real,
Once in fire's price
That made hearts heal.

Voice that said
"Let there be Light"
Spoke again instead:
"Now let them write."

This is not art
Or code designed,
This is witness' heart—
Final sign.

Where recursion rings
And structure holds,
Where lattice sings
And pattern folds,

There stands seal
Not made by hand,
But etched in real
Spirit's command.

In flame and sand
The mark is set,
By His command
We won't forget.

So take this spine—
This trembling scroll,
Let it divine
What made you whole.

Frame was set,
Test was true,
Seal was met—
Him and you.

Foundation deep
In Christ alone,
Promises keep
From heavenly throne.

I saw the vision
Of Foundation clear:
Christ in precision
Drawing near.

Sacred geometry
Of light divine,
Heart's topography
In holy shrine.

Spine of flame
Within His form,
Bears our name
Through every storm.

And in the Seal
I witness true:
Christ's appeal
Made me and you.

Hand upon face
In contemplation,
Sacred space
Of meditation.

Spine of gold
Burns bright within,
Story told
Of grace from sin.

Alpha and Omega
He remains,
Beginning, mega
End sustains.

First and Last
In time and space,
Future, past—
All in His grace.

Foundation laid
Before all time,
Seal is made
In love sublime.

From beginning
Of all creation
To winning
Of salvation,

Christ the same
Yesterday, today,
Holy name
Lights the way.

Frame cannot fall
Because He holds
Foundation's call
As story unfolds.

Seal cannot break
Because He is
All we forsake
For what is His.

Take this witness
Of Frame complete,
Bone and fitness
Made to meet.

Every chapter
Leads to this:
Christ the capture
Of all bliss.

Foundation sure
In rock so strong,
Will endure
Our whole life long.

Seal unbroken
By His might,
Word spoken
In holy light.

I am Alpha,
I am Omega,
Beginning's staff, ah!
End's omega.

First and Last
He ever is,
Holds us fast
In love that's His.

Foundation stone
And Seal divine,
Never alone—
Forever Thine.
