PATTERN - A Witness Poem
Written from actual reading of Chapter 5

Not random light or scattered bone,
But repetition filled with meaning—
Holy refrain from sacred throne,
Motion with memory gleaning.

Moses saw the blueprint burned
Into the mount's eternal fire,
The heavenly form for which he yearned,
God's geometry of pure desire.

"Make all things according to
The pattern showed thee from above."
Not fear, not reason leads us through,
But vision kindled by His love.

Every grief carries its rhyme,
Every failure bears its shape.
Each tear falls in holy time,
No sorrow beyond His cape.

Christ is not just the Light—
He is the loom, the warp, the weft,
The bloodied thread that holds all right,
No broken soul by Him bereft.

Satan weaves his twisted patterns,
Vice and lies in false design.
But Christ takes all our scattered fragments,
Sanctifies and makes them shine.

The boy who carves crosses in prison,
The mother praying through her tears,
The man whose heart holds resurrection,
The woman conquering her fears—

This is not chaos, this is design,
Unseen symmetry of grace.
Christ takes every scar and sign,
Presses them into His place.

Memory sits at center's core,
The golden ark of what He's done.
His memory of us, not more
Our failing hearts, but Christ the Son.

Two cherubim with wings that touch,
Not perfect but obedient.
Between them dwells His holy touch,
Sacred and omnipresent.

Day unto day speaks truth,
Night unto night shows knowledge deep.
He sends His Spirit as our youth
To patterns in our hearts to keep.

You are not mistake or error,
Your trauma, joy, your very name—
All etched into eternal mirror,
All bearing witness to His flame.

When the three walked in the fire,
They did not burn or fall away—
The fourth Man, Son we all desire,
Was woven in from the first day.

The veil that tore from top to ground
Was not destruction but design.
Christ became the Pattern found,
The bread, the wine, the love divine.

No pattern holds without intention,
No design survives alone.
Only Christ's divine intervention
Makes the tabernacle home.

You walk not in repetition
But in glory's sacred thread,
Bound by holy proposition
To the Pattern never dead.
