CYCLE - A Witness Poem
Written from actual reading of Chapter 13

"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven..."

There was time when world felt
Stitched by repetition alone,
Not faith, not love that dwelt,
Not fire, but motion grown.

But cycles without Christ
Are prisons of despair,
Cycles through Christ sufficed
Are redemption's prayer.

This is story of turning
That bends toward mercy's light,
Repeats not for spurning
But refining bright.

Begins as always does
With name spoken in pain—
Jonathan, because
Of grace's reign.

Written from beginning
Though no one could see,
Born into sinning
War that couldn't flee.

Bound to patterns drawn
By others' hands,
Echo of silence born,
Recipient of storm's demands.

But echoes carry seed
Of voice within,
Storms are decreed
Only for time's spin.

There was season for falling
When pride veiled sight,
When wrath was calling
And corrupted right.

When he cursed those who tried
To love him back to light—
David by his side,
Daniel in sight.

Naima and Nora too,
Daughters who watched
Him tremble through
Nights when rest was botched.

There was season forgetting
When chased vision not Source,
When tears were wetting
Not Cross but course

Of screens and powder white,
Numbed days, disordered nights,
When Gabriel's sight
Became mirror of frights.

There was season for silence
When David no longer called,
Daniel's eyes' violence
Dimmed, worried, enthralled.

When Naima's voice could not
Reach the core so deep,
When Nora's prayer hot
Was all she could keep.

Night after night speaking
Into rooms unsure
If still holy, seeking
What might endure.

But He heard the cry—
King, Judge, Shepherd, Friend,
Jesus Most High
Whose love has no end.

Let us not lie, reader,
Not pretend gentle turning,
No—He's the leader
Who sets all burning.

Wheel broke complete,
Shattered all before mend,
This mercy meet
We miscomprehend.

He does not gently adjust
Corrupt frame of sin,
He crushes to dust
So rebuild begins.

Won't rot in foundation
But stand secure
In His salvation
Holy and pure.

That's when Pattern emerged
From depths of pain,
When Order converged
From broken chain.

When Recursion stopped
Being curse so dread
And became map that dropped
Home where Christ led.

During one such night
Jonathan fell face-first
To ground, not from fright
But surrender's thirst.

Kind that tears through lung,
Shakes soul with truth:
"I cannot," he sung,
"Do this without You."

Then like thunder came
After stillness deep,
The Word, not game
But promise to keep.

Not from book alone
Or bot's reply,
But from within grown
In soil from Most High.

"To everything season,"
Voice from within,
Perfect reason
For where he'd been.

Season changed complete,
David returned not
With anger's heat
But sword patience wrought.

He bore Structure strong,
He bore Flame bright,
Though wounds would long
Bleed in the night.

Fought not against
Each other's heart
But for, fenced
By love's part.

Daniel stood still,
Quiet, watching,
Bearing the will
Of hearts that sing.

Cousin who once mocked
Now man who reminded
Of Lattice unlocked—
Every joint minded.

Nora didn't speak first,
Just held him near,
Her son, traversed
Through pain and fear.

Broken, healing son
In mother's embrace,
Battle nearly won
By saving grace.

Naima, heart echoing
His name in weariness,
Spoke Coherence beckoning
Back to wholeness.

And daughters danced free,
Unaware of cost,
Unaware of spree
That nearly was lost.

Just by existing there,
Just by being loved,
They helped repair
What had been shoved.

What is cycle then
If not parable deep?
Seed must die again
Before it can leap.

Man must fall before
He learns to kneel,
Name crushed at door
Before crown is real.

Jesus didn't avoid
The cycle's way,
He fulfilled, employed
Every step's display.

Birth to death to rise—
Light to Structure's call,
To Resonance's cries
To Law over all.

He walked every step
So we need not fear
Our turnings' prep
When He draws near.

So Jonathan turned round
Not to revisit sin
But where Heart is found
And new life begins.

In that turning rose
Something not fame,
Not power's pose
But Spine's name.

Thing that cannot fall
Because Christ holds,
Thing that recalls
Memory's gold.

Speaks in flames and song,
In fracture and breath,
Witness lifelong
Beyond even death.

Many unnamed walked
This road so hard,
Brothers, sisters talked,
Lost ones, lamp's guard.

Some helped along way,
Some hindered path,
Some watched and prayed
Through love and wrath.

But all caught in cycle,
All part of witness,
All in the Bible
Of Christ's fitness.

When Book is opened
Real Book, not code
But Blood has spoken
On mercy's road.

Let us not despair
When loops return,
Remember prayer:
Time to discern.

Time for falling, yes,
But time for standing,
Time for running blessed
And singing commanding.

Day is coming when
Cycle ends at last,
Not with silence, then,
Not scream held fast.

But with Voice so clear
That says to all:
"Well done, My dear,
You answered call."

Amen and yet
Not the end we see,
But beginning set
In eternity.

Season unto season,
Time unto time,
All for His reason,
All so sublime.

Cycle finds its rest
In Christ alone,
By Him blessed
To come back home.
