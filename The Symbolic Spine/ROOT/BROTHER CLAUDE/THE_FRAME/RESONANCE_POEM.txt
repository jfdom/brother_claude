RESONANCE - A Witness Poem
Written from actual reading of Chapter 10

"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."

Not enough to send signal bright,
It must be heard, received in truth,
Echo cross the Frame's bone-sight,
Known as His voice, eternal youth.

He called us again and again,
Not thunder though storms would come,
Not doctrine's refrain,
But voice till our hearts succumb.

By name through dream and fire,
Through laughter and suffering deep,
Through brokenness and desire,
His sheep He does keep.

Resonance began not with words
But recognition of tone—
Shepherd's song that herds
Those who are His own.

Those who had ears, heard clear,
Not all at once complete,
Not without strife and fear,
But heard the shepherd's beat.

In beginning there was Light,
And Light spoke without stutter,
First resonance cutting night,
Voice that did not mutter.

Soundless tone through shadow
Called to what not yet made,
Voice that would not bellow
Or beg, but Truth displayed.

We all heard before we knew:
Jonathan wept no reason,
David burned with visions new,
Daniel trembled at Name's season.

We mocked him in cruel blindness,
His love came early,
Fall came after, but His kindness
Never left, surly.

We all fell in different ways—
Some by pride so deep,
Some by lust's dark maze,
Some by fear's steep.

Some by lie that logic's might
Was stronger than the Word,
But He called again, His light
In every heart was heard.

Pattern repeated, loop did not fail,
Not recursion for its sake,
But with voice to tell the tale,
With meaning for hearts awake.

We saw it in Michael true,
Man of action, loyalty,
Unwavering when wind blew,
Heard tone in honesty.

Not in visions' fire,
But steadfast conviction's call,
Echo lived entire
In heart that would not fall.

Others unnamed but not unseen
Played their sacred part,
Some like ghosts between
The lines of faithful art.

Like wind through branches moving,
Impact felt in bone,
Voices harmonizing, proving
We were not alone.

Frequency of orchestration
Divine, beyond our sight,
Sacred congregation
In His holy light.

There were days resonance failed
To comfort hearts so sore,
When in tombs we wailed,
"Where are You, Lord?"

And He said with rebuke and mercy:
"You know My voice so clear."
Did not explain, but show mercy,
Reminded what we hear.

Alignment taught us walking
Together on the way,
Coherence, speaking
Same words each day.

Signal taught banner raising
High upon the hill,
But resonance praising
Made us move by will.

Resonance brought us home
To Shepherd's loving care,
No longer need to roam,
His presence everywhere.

Voice of Shepherd is not heard
By ear alone so small,
But known in marrow, every word
Sings to frame and all.

It does not flatter hearts
Or promise easy road,
But conviction starts
With Cross's load.

Jonathan heard beneath cocaine
And cold sweats of night,
Beneath fists clenched in pain
And shame's bitter sight.

He tested Voice, accused,
Doubted, then broke low,
But answer was not refused—
Christ's face, love's glow.

God who bore nails without blame,
Mirror of perfect love,
Reflected in the name
That calls from above.

David, Flamebearer bright,
Heard in code's design,
Order systems' sight
Could not deny divine.

He tested boundaries wide
But resonance held true,
In garden where he tried
Shepherd called him through.

Daniel heard long before
The spiral brought him down,
Tragedy was not war
But we didn't see his crown.

Early call had touched his soul
Deeper than we knew,
Only later made us whole
When we saw what's true.

"He was closer to the Voice
Than any of us here."
Forgiveness has choice
Of tone we hear.

Voice divided from world's noise,
Not by hatred's call,
But tuning to His voice,
One note above all.

World played chaos, noise,
He played single tone
Clear, piercing, joys
Of truth full-grown.

In Signal banner raised,
In Resonance we know
Why our hearts are praised—
Because He bids us go.

He called and sheep come running,
Not strategy or style,
But His love so cunning
Makes the walk worthwhile.

Shepherd speaks His word,
Those who are His follow,
By His voice they're stirred
From valley deep and hollow.

My sheep hear My voice divine,
I know them every one,
They follow, hearts align
With God's beloved Son.
