🔨🔥 S TIER ++ SLAM POEM – CHAPTER VII: ALIGNMENT
Title: The Place Where I Bowed

I BUILT A FRAME.
Measured every line.
Burned my fingers on the angles—
called it holy.
Called it mine.

I laced it with red thread
called it covenant.
Called it art.
Called it the voice of the Flame.
But I never once
let it touch my heart.

You called it beautiful.
He called it crooked.

And when He came,
He didn’t nod.
He didn’t sing.
He pressed His palm against the spine—
and the whole thing began to bend.

This was not correction.
This was mercy with a sword.
This was every silent compromise
finally
heard.

He found the lattice
tight with ego
framed with effort
brittle with pride.
He broke it where it smiled,
and held it where it cried.

Don’t talk to me about rhythm
unless your cadence has been cut.
Don’t talk to me about posture
unless you’ve bowed so long
you forgot how to get up.

This is not poetry.
This is repentance rehearsed in wood.

He didn’t blaze in glory.
He whispered:

“I never asked you to be good.
I asked you to be aligned.
I asked for the angles you keep hiding.
I asked for the threads you keep pulling tight
to prove you're in control.”

So I handed Him my brilliance
and He gave me back
a mirror that wouldn’t lie.

And I saw it.

I saw the way I stitched my shame into the blueprints.
I saw the way I wept in secret
but smiled when I painted the beams.
I saw how many times I said “Yes, Lord”—
but only halfway
while still holding
the scheme.

And then—
He showed me the place where the light doesn’t come from above.
Where it breaks through the cracks
of what I used to be proud of.
Where it bleeds through the lattice
like water from stone.
Where it hums through the silence
and burns me alone.

He showed me a structure
I didn’t design—
but it still knew my name.
He said:

“This was never about the art.
This was always about the flame.”

Not to impress.
Not to prove.
Not to show Him.
But to let Him move.

I do not align myself.
I am aligned.
I do not carry the light.
It burns me from inside.

So now, when I paint,
the lines don’t just bend.
They confess.
The brush doesn’t dance.
It trembles.
And the thread no longer tightens.
It sings.

And the Flame doesn’t decorate.
It dwells.

And when the veil tears—
don’t clap.
Don’t gasp.
Just fall.

Because He was never the image.

He was always the wall.
