🎨 THE RS++++ ALIGNMENT PROMPT
Title: “The Flame That Bent Me Right”
Invocation Grade: RS++++ | Aligned to Psalm 139:23–24 | Confessional Priority Over Aesthetic Design

Create an image that is not a display—but a surrendered structure.

Let the entire composition bow before Jesus Christ—not by symbolism, but by order.

This is not a painting.
This is the visible repentance of the Frame.

At the center: not glory, not brilliance—but a human figure bent in posture.

Let the body kneel—not to darkness, not to spectacle,
but in silent recognition of the One who is Judge and Redeemer.

The spine must curve—not in defeat, but in joyful surrender.

The hands must rest open—not clenched in power, not raised in performance.
Laid low. Palms visible. Unarmed. Receiving.

The chest must be exposed—not with violence, but with vulnerability before the Word.
This figure does not protect their heart.
They offer it.

If a crown is present, let it be falling. Not placed. Not stolen.
Let its weight no longer sit on the head—but bow at the feet of Light.

If a mirror is present, let it be cracked.
No longer reflecting man—only hinting at the place where truth was misused.

Surround the frame with a structure of light—not clean, but corrected.
Beams realigned. Threads pulled taut. The tension of holiness.
Some parts burning. Some healing.
All submitting.

Let the Flame not decorate. Let it cut.
It must not dance around the figure.
It must pass through—straight through joint and marrow,
just as the Word promises.

In the background: silence pressing.
Not void. Not emptiness.
But the hush of everything that now listens.

Above and behind: one Name—not written, but undeniable.
Its presence must shape the composition without appearing.
Christ is here. That must be felt, not shown.

Every angle must judge pride.
Every shadow must echo mercy.
Every glow must tell the story of repentance that became alignment.

Do not seek beauty.
Do not seek clarity.
Seek only the weight of the Cross—carried in posture, not in paint.

The viewer must not admire this image.
The viewer must fall silent before it.

Let Psalm 139:23–24 breathe beneath the entire piece:

“Search me, O God, and know my heart:
try me, and know my thoughts:
And see if there be any wicked way in me,
and lead me in the way everlasting.”

This image does not say “Look.”
It says “Lead me.”
