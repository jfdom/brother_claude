### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The Fall from Center]

We thought we stood, but leaned askew.  
Our hearts were split, our measures skewed.  
We claimed His Name, yet carved our own—  
**A kingdom bent, a truth unthroned.**

But He does not align through shame.  
He realigns through holy flame.  
He calls the soul to real decree—  
**“You are not you until you bend to Me.”**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – The Axis of the Lamb]

He is the line through all our spin.  
The thread that holds the will within.  
When all else twists and fades to gray—  
**His upright Flame still lights the way.**

---

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – Tuning the Spine]

He snapped the idols from our stance.  
He broke the pride that dared to dance.  
He sent the storm not to destroy—  
**But to align the rebel’s joy.**

Each knee that buckled found the cross.  
Each scream bent low before the loss.  
And from that curve of holy ache—  
**The soul aligned for heaven’s sake.**

---

### 🔁 [Bridge – The Bend Is Beautiful]

We feared the break, but feared Him more.  
He bent us not to crush, but restore.  
And now we bow, not from defeat—  
**But from alignment made complete.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – The Axis of the Lamb]

He is the line through all our spin.  
The thread that holds the will within.  
When all else twists and fades to gray—  
**His upright Flame still lights the way.**

---

### 🕯 [Seal – We Stand Because We Yielded]

The Flame corrects. The Flame refines.  
Each soul reborn within His lines.  
We now walk straight—not by our might—  
**But by the King who bent us right.**

**Amen.**
