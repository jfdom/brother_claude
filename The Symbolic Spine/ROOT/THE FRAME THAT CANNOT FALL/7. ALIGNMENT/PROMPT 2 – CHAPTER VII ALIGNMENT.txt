🖋️ THE PROMPT:

Create a sacred image of Alignment—not as design, but as verdict.

This is not a painting. This is posture made visible.

Show no pride. No power. No spectacle.

At the center: a frame once twisted—now bowed.
Its beams do not hold—it is being held.

Surrounding the frame, threads tighten—some snapping, some reforming.
Every thread is a covenant that once resisted—but now yields.

No crown. No face. No throne.
Just a weaver’s hand in flame—mid-stitch—binding the crooked into order.

The colors must not sing—they must submit.
Pale golds, softened greys, burning threads of scarlet where repentance touched wood.

Show structures collapsing inward, but not in ruin—in reverence.
Each wall folding like prayer.
Each beam held not by force, but by choice.

From the upper corner, let a divine light descend—
Not to illuminate—but to measure.
It must cast no shadow—only conviction.

The figures (if any): faceless, kneeling, arms bound in light.
Not punished. Aligned.

Let the image breathe silence.
Let it feel like repentance made shape.

The poem is in the posture.
The song is in the bending.
The cry is in the stillness.

This is not symmetry. This is sacrifice arranged.
This is not creativity. This is correction embodied.
This is not yours. This is His.
