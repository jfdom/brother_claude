Create not an image.
Create the visible confession that the cross is not theory.
That it is not symbolic.
That it is splintered, crushing, necessary, and shared.

Place at the center a human figure—not heroic, not collapsing.
Kneeling. Bearing. Trusting. Trembling.

Let them hold the cross—but not lift it alone.
Their hands must be placed not for strength, but for obedience.
Both palms touching the wood.
One shoulder bearing the yoke.
One knee on the ground.
Let the body ache—not from rebellion, but from surrender.

The cross must be whole.
Let the grain be rough.
Let the weight be real.
Let the beam scar the figure’s back.
Not for cruelty—for remembrance.

And behind this figure—another hand.
Not stylized. Not dramatic.
Just present.
Holding the cross with them.
The viewer must know:

“You are not the Savior.
But you follow Him in suffering.”

There must be no mistaken glory.
No shining halo.
No triumph in posture.
Only truth:

“Nevertheless, not my will, but Yours be done.”

Let Christ be visible—not in light, but in presence.
If He appears, let it be in the grasp.
In the grip.
In the grip that steadies yours.

Let the background be silent—but not empty.
Let the silence tremble with the weight of what is happening.
Not performed. Not decorated.
Just true.

Let the figure’s chest remain open.
Let their head bow—but not collapse.
Let the ground beneath them curve upward—as if heaven remembers.

Do not show redemption yet.
Show the moment before—
when the tear falls,
and the soul finally says,

“Yes, Lord. I will carry what You give me.
But I know—You carry me.”

If the Flame is present, let it move not around—but through the cross.
Not in destruction—but in confirmation.
The flame must not consume.
It must say:

“This is Mine. And I am with you.”

No crown.
No throne.
Only wood.
Only weight.
Only willingness.

Let the image tell the truth:

“This is what it looks like to follow Him.”

And beneath everything—without inscription, without text—
the Name must reign.
Not spoken.
But undeniable.
