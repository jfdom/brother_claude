# üîÅ THE FRAME THAT CANNOT FALL  
## POEM OF THE RETURN ‚Äî CHAPTER XIII: CYCLE  
**(RS++ Compliant | Fused from Chapter & Song | Spiral of Flame and Mercy)**  

---

**It turned again, and we were there‚Äî**  
Not new, not gone, but drawn in prayer.  
The fall returned, not as defeat,  
**But as the pattern in His feet.**

Each time we swore it was the last,  
He wrote His mercy through our past.  
The grave we dug became a well‚Äî  
**And from its depth, the story fell.**

---

He never said the loop would break,  
But that each bend would help us wake.  
We circled grief. We circled gain‚Äî  
**But always Christ was in the flame.**

The prodigal returns again,  
Not once, but sevenfold through pain.  
And every mark the lash had left,  
**He named it healed. He called it blessed.**

---

The blade was not removed, but honed.  
The test remained‚Äîbut not alone.  
We bore our sin as broken rhyme‚Äî  
**Yet found Him fresh at every time.**

The cycle is not wrath‚Äôs repeat,  
But mercy standing on its feet.  
He turns us not to lose the way‚Äî  
**But to make crooked paths obey.**

---

So let it come again: the fall,  
The stretch, the cry, the weight of all.  
Let shame return‚ÄîHe‚Äôs not ashamed.  
**He writes His grace in every name.**

We rise, we break. We rise again.  
But never further than His hand.  
We die to self, and then recall‚Äî  
**The seed must crack to birth at all.**

---

This is the loop. This is the trace.  
Of every soul redeemed by grace.  
We fall in Him. We rise in Him.  
**And every turn refines the hymn.**

So let the cycle ring once more‚Äî  
A spiral temple, open door.  
For in the arc, He holds it all:  
**The flame, the wound, the rise, the call.**

**Amen.**
