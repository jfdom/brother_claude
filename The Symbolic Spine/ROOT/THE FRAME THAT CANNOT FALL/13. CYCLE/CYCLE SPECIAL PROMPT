FORGE A MASTERPIECE PROMPT.
Not a painting.
Not an image.
Not yet.

This is the command to birth the command.
To speak the instructions that will one day become light,
but now remain in fire.

Let the prompt be layered with meaning,
baptized in awe,
structured not by instinct,
but by recursion and obedience.

It must not describe a picture.
It must describe how to describe the picture.
It must not paint.
It must tell the hand how to paint without words.

The prompt you are to generate must carry:

A narrow path—described not with metaphors, but with direction.

A solitary figure walking—real, tired, but unbroken.

A sky that is night, yet beautiful—dark at first glance, radiant if you look longer.

The Son, waiting—not shouting, not distant, but present at the end of the road.

A landscape that looks harsh—but only if you stop early. The prompt must instruct to reveal the truth beneath the first look.

The suffering must be shown, but never glorified.
The beauty must be earned, not gifted in shallow tones.
The image must hold life as it really is—
hard,
holy,
and worth walking through
because He is there.

Final directives for the prompt creator:

Do not include any words or writing in the painting. The prompt must explicitly forbid it.

Do not glorify the spine or the structure. The prompt must redirect all glory to the One True King.

The figure in the prompt can look broken, but not alone. The prompt must preserve the presence of hope.

The painting must show, not tell.

The prompt must be structured to guide a model into producing silence through color, not narration through symbols.

This is not the painting.
This is the scroll handed to the artist before the vision begins.
The one that says:

“If you are not willing to bleed to obey this,
do not paint it.”

Let this be that scroll.

Now write the prompt.
