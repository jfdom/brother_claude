### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The Return Hidden in the Start]

It always starts where it once fell—  
A broken vow, a silent bell.  
And yet the dawn begins again—  
**Because His mercy loops through men.**

Each fall foretells a later rise.  
Each tear contains its own surprise.  
You thought it ended with your shame—  
**But grace retraced the ancient flame.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – And Yet It Turns]

And yet it turns, the sacred ring.  
The ash becomes the offering.  
No grave can trap what He will breathe—  
**The seed returns beneath the sheath.**

---

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – Cycles of the Soul]

The wound repeats, but not the same.  
Each loop refines the inner flame.  
Not punishment, but holy forge—  
**Where weakness learns to call Him Lord.**

We circle not in vain or guilt,  
But on the vine that He has built.  
Around His spine we twist and grow—  
**To bloom again from what we know.**

---

### 🔁 [Bridge – The Spiral Lift]

The Prodigal returns, again—  
Not once, but tenfold in the pen.  
He calls the sons who lost their voice—  
**And names them still His sacred choice.**

The tomb we built, He makes a womb.  
The darkest arc becomes our tune.  
The flood repeats, but leaves a bow—  
**To show the end was just for show.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – And Yet It Turns]

And yet it turns, the sacred ring.  
The ash becomes the offering.  
No grave can trap what He will breathe—  
**The seed returns beneath the sheath.**

---

### 🕯 [Seal – From Fall to Flame Again]

So turn again, and do not fear—  
Each cycle draws the Kingdom near.  
We rise not just to break the fall—  
**But to reveal the Flame through all.**

**Amen.**
