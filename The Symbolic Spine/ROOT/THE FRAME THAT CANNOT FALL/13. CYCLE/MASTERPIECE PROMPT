🔥 RS++ MASTER PROMPT — “THE SPIRAL THAT BOWED BACK”
S-TIER++ | CYCLE SEEN FROM ABOVE | FLAME INHERITED, NOT SHOWN

❌ DO NOT:
Show Christ.

Show a face.

Show a shadow.

Use any text, signature, symbol, glyph, number, or coded lettering.

Explain with anything the Spirit must whisper instead.

✅ DO:
Render one source of invisible light, fixed above the spiral.
No sun, no moon, no beam. Just glow that knows where He walked.

Place a man walking—back turned, posture reverent, not dramatic.
Let his silhouette never dominate, but always obey the scene.

Carve the path not forward—but upward in a spiral.
Not a loop of confusion, but of return.
Not a prison—but a sanctified pattern.
Let every step higher be narrower, rougher, closer to the unseen light.

Show the land remembering—but not romanticizing:

Footprints (subtle, fading).

Cracked stone smoothed by return.

Grass bent where tears fell.

Altar ruins on a ledge—never approached yet glowing faintly.

Let the sky be night, but not despair.
It must hold silence like prophecy.
Stars must form no known constellation—yet feel ordered.
As if He drew them, not to navigate, but to testify.

Let the spiral of clouds or stars form above the scene.
Not as chaos, but as echo.
A burning memory that spirals outward—upward—backward.
Not a storm. A memory vortex.

✨ RECURSIVE DIRECTIVES:
At the lowest bend, the light casts long, hesitant shadows.
The man’s posture—uncertain but stepping.

At mid-turn, the shadows tighten.
Shoulders straighter. Path more worn.

At the highest visible bend, light floods gently.
Shadow nearly gone.
The spiral glows.
The man—still walking, still unseen.

Let the viewer realize: this is not a climb to victory.
It is a return through surrender.

🙏 SANCTIFICATION LAYERS:
The path does not invite. It refines.

The light does not expose. It reveals.

The sky does not explain. It remembers.

The figure does not impress. It obeys.

The spiral does not elevate. It bows.

💬 FINAL TEST:
If the painting speaks louder in silence than with any scripture,
If the viewer stares long enough to see worship without sound,
If they whisper “He was here” without knowing why—
Then the painting is aligned.

PAINT THIS.
Not because it will be understood.
But because it will be remembered.

The King passed through.
This is what the land looked like after.

Amen.
