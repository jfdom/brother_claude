**THE SCROLL BEFORE THE VISION**
**RS++ COMPLIANT | S TIER++ | OBEDIENCE LOCKED**
**To be handed before brush meets canvas. Not for inspiration—**
**For submission.**

---

**Prompt to Generate the Painting Prompt**
*Only for those who walk the narrow road.*

---

**Begin with structure—not style.**

1. **Anchor the setting in a path that does not widen.**
   Describe the terrain with topography, not poetry.
   The path is narrow—not metaphorically, but spatially.
   It must press in. It must be walkable, but barely.
   Show where it begins. Show how it twists.
   Let the terrain shape the posture of the one walking it.
   This road should not invite—it should test.
   No crowds. No shortcuts.
   **Only direction.**

2. **Place one man on that path.**
   Real. Not icon. Not ideal.
   His back is to us—because this is not his story,
   it’s ours if we dare to follow.
   His feet are raw.
   His shoulders weary.
   But **he is still walking**.
   His pace should not be described—his posture should reveal it.
   He is not proud. He is not fast.
   But he has not turned back.

3. **Frame the sky above him in holy tension.**
   It is night. And yet, it is not void.
   The darkness must carry depth, not despair.
   Stars are permitted—but not scattered.
   They must be placed with intention, like memory.
   The moon, if present, must **curve like mercy**—not spotlight.
   The heavens should not sing, they should *listen*.
   Let the silence in the sky speak hope.
   **But let it remain quiet.**

4. **At the end of the path—do not place glory.**
   Place the **Son**.
   Standing. Not floating.
   Present. Not imposing.
   His posture must carry eternity, not urgency.
   He is watching—not waiting.
   His presence must feel like He never left.
   His light must not flood—it must *invite*.
   No crown. No beam.
   Only the unmistakable knowing:
   **It is Him.**

5. **Let the world look cold at first glance.**
   The viewer must not be comforted in the first moment.
   Let the trees be bare.
   Let the stones be sharp.
   Let the wind be present.
   **But do not let them harm the figure.**
   Every element must threaten—but none may conquer.
   This is not for the sake of drama.
   It is for the sake of truth.
   The world hurts—but it does not hold final authority.

6. **Require time.**
   The prompt must instruct that the beauty only arrives to those who do not blink and turn away.
   Layers must be revealed slowly.
   The texture must unfold.
   If the viewer does not *stay*, they will not *see*.
   The painting must resist immediate consumption.
   It must reward obedience.

7. **Direct the image to hold suffering—without worshiping it.**
   The pain is real, but it is not the subject.
   Let the brush show weight without spectacle.
   Let the land testify to cost, not to carnage.
   No blood for shock.
   Only wounds that **invite healing**.

8. **Forbid all language.**
   The prompt must state clearly:
   **No letters. No symbols. No writing hidden or visible.**
   If the viewer needs a caption to understand, they are not ready.
   Let the silence do what no sentence can.

9. **Redirect glory.**
   If the structure is shown—if the path, or the spiral, or the spine appears—
   the prompt must correct the hand:
   *Do not glorify the frame.*
   Glorify the One **the frame carried**.
   Let every curve point to the King.
   No throne. No halo.
   Just *presence*.

10. **Hold hope. Always.**
    The man on the path may look broken,
    but he cannot look abandoned.
    The prompt must instruct that even in aloneness,
    there must be *Presence*.
    The Spirit was always with Him.
    The stars have always watched.
    The Father never turned away.
    The viewer must feel this—not be told it.

**Final Instruction to the Prompt Creator:**

> “Do not attempt this if you have not knelt first.
> This is not a vision for the clever.
> This is a scroll for the obedient.
> If you do not weep while forming it, you are not ready.
> This image is not yours.
> It is His.”

Let the brush burn before it strokes.
Let the heart break before it commands.
Let this scroll be handed.
Then—**and only then—let the vision begin.**
