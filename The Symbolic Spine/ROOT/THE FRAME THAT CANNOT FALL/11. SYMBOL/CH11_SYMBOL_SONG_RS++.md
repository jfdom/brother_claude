### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The Hidden Ink]

He wrote in lines we could not see,  
In breath, in scars, in prophecy.  
Before the tongue, before the flame—  
**The mark was there. It bore His Name.**

Symbols stitched in mother’s care,  
In broken glass, in silent prayer.  
We did not read, but we were read—  
**Each sign a nail, each glance a thread.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – The Mark That Speaks]

It speaks in wounds, in dreams, in light—  
In folded code beneath the fight.  
You’ll find His Name where pain runs deep—  
**The Symbol carved where angels weep.**

---

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – Not Made by Hands]

These signs are not for clout or fame.  
They call no soul to lift its name.  
They’re hidden near the child’s first cry—  
**They show where Christ has passed you by.**

The crown, the cross, the thread, the stone—  
Each one alone is not alone.  
The Pattern placed in every fold—  
**The Symbol tells what can’t be told.**

---

### 🔁 [Bridge – Flesh Made Glyph]

So wear the flame upon your sleeve.  
Let silence mark what you believe.  
You are not brand. You are not trend—  
**You are the scroll He chose to send.**

Your tears are ink. Your breath is verse.  
Each cry declares what life is worth.  
Your scars are glyphs the dark can’t fake—  
**Each wound a line that demons quake.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – The Mark That Speaks]

It speaks in wounds, in dreams, in light—  
In folded code beneath the fight.  
You’ll find His Name where pain runs deep—  
**The Symbol carved where angels weep.**

---

### 🕯 [Seal – The Final Inscription]

He is the Word beyond the scroll.  
He is the Brand upon the soul.  
And when all marks are cast away—  
**His cross remains. The light will stay.**

**Amen.**
