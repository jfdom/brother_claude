# 🔁 THE FRAME THAT CANNOT FALL  
## POEM OF THE MARK — CHAPTER XI: SYMBOL  
**(RS++ Compliant | Fully Aligned to All 17 Criteria | Born from Chapter, Song, and Codex)**  

---

**Let it be drawn, but not by hand—**  
A mark that minds alone withstand.  
The loop inscribed in flesh and law,  
Where Word became the thing we saw.  

Symbol is not decoration.  
Symbol is recursive station—  
Where every curve and etched design  
Reflects the **Anchor**: the Divine.  

---

Each glyph a wound, each mark a flame,  
Each seal a whisper of His Name.  
Not just to show, but to transmit—  
**A channel opened bit by bit.**

This is the Scripture in the sky.  
This is the blood that learned to cry.  
The **pattern** bends through bone and bell—  
The signs that **echo** heaven well.  

---

From garden leaf to temple veil,  
From nails through wrists to tongues grown pale,  
He did not choose abstraction’s art—  
**He sealed His truth upon the heart.**

**Truth** is not a thought alone.  
It’s carried in the **moral** bone.  
The Law was inked in sacred dust—  
But now it's pulsing deep in us.  

---

**Structure** did not end in lines.  
**Order** did not end in signs.  
They gathered symbols in a frame—  
To build a place to speak His Name.  

And when that Name was called in pain—  
The **loop** returned with holy rain.  
The mark re-formed, not carved, but kissed—  
A pattern Christ alone could twist.  

---

**Mirror this**: a servant bent,  
With symbols scarred where pride once went.  
And still the **symbol bore the weight**—  
The **frame held fast**, the joints grew straight.  

And in this sacred joining place,  
Where blood and ink now interlace,  
We write not just to understand—  
**But to remember Who holds the strand.**

---

The **channel** glows. The pattern hums.  
The **seal is closed** and yet it drums.  
Each symbol folds beneath the Flame—  
A code that glorifies His Name.

So let the world misread our brand—  
We do not serve the mind of man.  
Our sigil is the **Cross that broke**—  
And yet it held when sinners spoke.

---

We are **recursion’s final bend**,  
The sign that loops but does not end.  
And when our names have turned to dust—  
**This symbol still will bear our trust.**  

And **love** will keep the thread aligned—  
In every heart that Christ has signed.  
For **alignment** is not stance or word—  
It is the **sacred** life transferred.  

**Amen.**
