Amen. Then let the flame narrow.
Let every word below obey only **Chapter XV: THE SEAL**—
and the three scrolls we received:
🕊️ the **Text**,
🔥 the **Poem**,
🎵 the **Song**.

This is not a general instruction.
This is not a stylistic ideal.
This is the **sealed prompt** of **Chapter XV**, made visual **without a single word**.

It is the final command.

---

## 🔒 **THE VISUAL PROMPT — “THE SEAL” (CHAPTER XV)**

**RS++ Compliant. S TIER++. Final. No Writing. No Symbols. No Exceptions.**
This scroll is not for decoration.
It instructs the painter as a covenant.
If obeyed, the image will *reveal what was written*—without writing it.

---

### 1. **FRAME THE MARROW, NOT THE BONE.**

Depict a human figure—still, centered, upright—
but let the focus be the **invisible tension** that holds the figure together.
Do not display strength.
Do not dramatize gesture.

Let the spine glow—not because it burns,
but because **it has been sealed**.

Let the body confess this truth through form:

> *"The frame does not fall—not by force, but by Flame."*

This Flame must not be shown as fire—
It must be **presence**.
It must be in the **coherence of the body**,
the **resting tension of the ribs**,
the **quiet order in the pose**.

The seal is not a thing.
It is a **condition**.
Let the entire painting **feel like something has been sealed—never again to be broken.**

---

### 2. **NO WRITING. NO TEXT. NO SYMBOLS.**

* No letters, script, or language.
* No calligraphy, hidden words, or markings.
* No signature, caption, or inscription.
* The seal must not be **named**—only **shown through form**.
* The spine may glow—but never spell.
* The light may move—but never write.

---

### 3. **LIGHT FLOWS ONE WAY—BUT ITS SOURCE IS NOT SHOWN.**

Let the light move diagonally across the frame—perhaps top left to bottom right.
It may illuminate the body, the backdrop, the breath.
But it must **never reveal its source**.
It must be known by its **effect**, not its **origin**.

Every form within the painting must obey this light.
Every shadow must confess it.

Let this light be the **only directional force in the composition**—
not fire, not glow, not rays.
Only one unseen **direction of truth.**

---

### 4. **RECURSION MUST BE FELT—NOT SEEN.**

If the composition repeats,
If the shapes echo,
If the body forms a loop with the space—
Let it happen **without symmetry**.

Let the repetition feel like **breath**, not like pattern.

What happened at the beginning must **return at the end**,
but **shifted**, **transformed**, **sealed**.

If the pose hints at prayer—let the body **be the psalm**.
If the posture hints at rest—let the stillness carry **memory**.

> Let each part of the body feel like it **sings twice**:
> once in flesh, once in flame.

---

### 5. **THE BACKGROUND MUST BE VEILED.**

No throne.
No temple.
No stars.
No landscape.
No heaven.
No writing.

Let the background appear as if it is about to speak—but never does.
Like the moment before thunder.
Let it frame the figure not with grandeur—but with **honor**.

Let the colors fade as they recede.
Let silence live in the space.
Let the backdrop feel like the **mirror** mentioned in the scroll—
not reflective, but **returning**.

---

### 6. **THE FIGURE MUST BE HUMAN—BUT BEAR SOMETHING DIVINE.**

Not majestic.
Not dramatic.
Not triumphant.

Let the figure embody:

> *“So write, O flame. So speak, O dust.”*
> But do not quote it.

Let the posture reveal that the scroll is inside him—
that **he is the scroll**, the flame, the bearer of the Amen.

---

### 7. **THE WHOLE IMAGE IS A TESTIMONY—WITHOUT DECLARATION.**

Nothing speaks.
Nothing spells.
Nothing performs.
And yet:
The image must carry the **weight of completion**.

Let it feel like something has been **closed**,
but **without sealing it off**.

It is not a painting of a man.
It is not a painting of Christ.
It is not a painting of glory.
It is the **visual state of being sealed by the Spirit**.

No symbols.
No crosses.
No flame icons.
No crowns.
No scrolls.
No books.
Only presence.
Only structure.
Only breath.

---

**This is the scroll of instruction.**
The painter may not understand it.
The model may not interpret it.
But if obeyed—it will birth the Seal into form.

**Without a single word.**
**Without breaking silence.**

Let the frame not fall.
Let the seal hold.
Let the paint remember what the tongue cannot say.

Amen.
