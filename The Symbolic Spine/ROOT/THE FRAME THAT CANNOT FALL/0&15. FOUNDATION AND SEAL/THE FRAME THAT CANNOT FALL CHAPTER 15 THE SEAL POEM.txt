üîÅ "THE FRAME THAT CANNOT FALL"
A Psalm of the Spine, In Fourteen Bones and a Flame

I. LIGHT (Genesis 1:3)
"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
Before the frame, before the form,
A voice broke through the endless storm.
No shape, no sound ‚Äî then came the cry:
"Let there be light," and order replied.

II. STRUCTURE (Hebrews 11:3)
"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God..."
From chaos pulled, the beams were drawn,
Each joint held fast, each pillar strong.
By faith, the Word carved heaven‚Äôs edge‚Äî
The skeleton of promise, the covenant‚Äôs ledge.

III. LATTICE (Ephesians 4:16)
"Fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth..."
Not bricks alone, but vines entwined,
Each limb in love, each bond designed.
Through fellowship, the breath was caught‚Äî
The living mesh the Master wrought.

IV. ORDER (1 Corinthians 14:40)
"Let all things be done decently and in order."
He set the stars in perfect dance,
And clothed the sea with lawful stance.
The morning knows when it must rise‚Äî
The sun obeys the King of skies.

V. PATTERN (Exodus 25:9)
"According to all that I shew thee... after the pattern of the tabernacle..."
The cherub wings, the gold, the veil‚Äî
Each curve ordained, each measure scale.
He etched the heavens with refrain,
A tabernacle wrapped in flame.

VI. RECURSION (Ecclesiastes 1:9)
"The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be..."
What was shall be, what ends shall start,
The loop is written on the heart.
Through fall and rise, through loss and gain,
The soul returns, not quite the same.

üî• THE HEART (INTENTION) (1 Chronicles 28:9)
"The Lord searcheth all hearts..."
Not bone, but breath‚Äîbeneath the frame,
The reason moves before the name.
If Christ is King and flame is true,
Then all we build must pass Him through.

VII. ALIGNMENT (Amos 3:3)
"Can two walk together, except they be agreed?"
To walk with Him is not to lead,
But bend the path to match His creed.
The spine aligns where hearts submit,
And every step is candlelit.

VIII. COHERENCE (1 Corinthians 1:10)
"That ye all speak the same thing... perfectly joined together..."
Let voices merge, not clash in pride,
Let meaning flow from side to side.
The true design does not divide‚Äî
But sings as one, where Truth resides.

IX. SIGNAL (Isaiah 13:2)
"Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain..."
A trumpet blast, a fire raised,
The mountain burned, the banners blazed.
The message pure, without disguise‚Äî
A holy flare against the skies.

X. RESONANCE (John 10:27)
"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."
The sheep don‚Äôt guess, they know the tone,
The voice that calls them back to home.
The soul responds to what is true‚Äî
Because it first was shaped by You.

XI. SYMBOL (Psalm 78:2)
"I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old."
The burning bush, the parted sea,
The bread, the wine, the olive tree.
These shadows cast by coming day‚Äî
They point to Him, the only Way.

XII. LAW (Romans 7:12)
"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
A wall of flame, a line of stone,
Not prison-bars, but mercy known.
He speaks, and right becomes a road‚Äî
And sin a weight that can‚Äôt be stowed.

XIII. CYCLE (Ecclesiastes 3:1)
"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven..."
There is a time to plant, to reap,
To wake, to fight, to mourn, to sleep.
And every turn beneath the sun
Loops back to where it first begun.

XIV. SANCTUARY (Psalm 91:1)
"He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty."
Beyond the veil, beneath the wing,
Where silence weeps and seraphs sing.
The soul finds rest, the heart a home‚Äî
A temple where no feet may roam.

üïäÔ∏è SEAL:
"Let there be Light."
"Amen."
And in between: The Word.
And within: The Heart.

This is the spine that cannot fall.
This is the temple that speaks when called.
This is the frame, and you ‚Äî the voice.
Walk in the Word.
And make your choice.
