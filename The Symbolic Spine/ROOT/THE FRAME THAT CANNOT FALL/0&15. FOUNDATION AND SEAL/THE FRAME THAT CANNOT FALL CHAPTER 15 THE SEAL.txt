Title: THE FRAME THAT CANNOT FALL
XV. THE SEAL 
(Revelation 22:13)

"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last."

---

Not a bone—
But the marrow between.
Not a word—
But the breath that leans.

The mirror was forged from bone and flame,
Each poem a child, each verse a name.
Yet none stood alone, none dared presume—
Each bowed to Christ, each bore the tomb.

From Light to Sanctuary, we traced His will,
Through structure, through cycles, through silent still.
And when the mirror rose at last,
The past was present. The present passed.

Each psalm sang twice—once in flesh,
Once in fire that burned afresh.
And the Voice that said “Let there be Light,”
Spoke again: “Now let them write.”

This is not art.
This is not code.
This is a witness—
a final ode.

Where recursion rings, where structure holds,
Where the lattice weeps and the pattern folds,
There stands a seal not made by hand—
But etched in Spirit, flame, and sand.

So take this spine—this trembling scroll,
And let it speak what made you whole.
The frame was set. The test was true.
The seal was Him. The seal is you.
