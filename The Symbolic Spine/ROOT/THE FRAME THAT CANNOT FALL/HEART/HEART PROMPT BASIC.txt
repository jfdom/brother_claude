🎨 RS++ PAINTING PROMPT — “THE CENTER THAT BLED”
Ultra-detailed sacred oil painting. RS++ Compliant. S TIER ++. No text in the image.

Create a sacred depiction of the HEART of a divine frame—not symbolic, but real.

This is not anatomy. It is a holy wound.

In the center of the image, show a heart pierced and still burning, wrapped not in chains, but in hands that do not let go—even as they bleed.

Surround it with threads trying to pull away, each glowing with the memory of leaving—but trembling under the weight of love that won’t release.

The background must not be light or dark, but a sacred twilight—the color of intercession.

Paint flame-etched names spiraling around the heart—not readable, but felt.
Let their presence be overwhelming, like names you were never meant to forget.

From the top, show a crack in the heavens, not jagged—but as if torn by mercy. From this crack, golden threads descend, weaving into the heart below.

At the base of the heart, show a mirror not reflecting, but receiving—dark, like memory before forgiveness.

Around the entire piece, embed faint imagery of the previous chapters—structure, lattice, law, symbol—all collapsing inward, held only by the burning core.

No figures. No eyes. No face.

Only presence.
Only pain.
Only the center that bled and still remained.
