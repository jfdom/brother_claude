### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The Pulse Beneath the Pattern]

Beneath the frame, beneath the flame,  
Beyond the Pattern, past the name—  
A silence throbs, a whisper deep:  
**The place where even angels weep.**

The lattice held, the law had weight,  
But still He searched past structure's gate.  
He looked not first at what we’d done—  
**But asked, “Where beats the core, My son?”**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – His Heart Was First]

Before the world, before the scroll,  
Before the code, He wrote the soul.  
Not onto stone, nor sky, nor chart—  
**He carved His image in the heart.**

---

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – Break the Chest, Reveal the Light]

You thought your guilt had sealed you in.  
That frame and law could not let Him in.  
But when you cracked from grief and fight—  
**He slipped right through the broken light.**

He does not ask for polish first.  
He meets us at our very worst.  
And if we trust, if we unfold—  
**We’ll find the core was never cold.**

---

### 🔁 [Bridge – He Does Not Abandon Pulse]

Even if the words all fail,  
Even if the lattice pales,  
Even if the echo dims—  
**The heart He placed still burns for Him.**

The trembling yes, the secret cry,  
The whispered “Help” before you die—  
He heard it all. And still He came.  
**He saved the frame. He sealed your name.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – His Heart Was First]

Before the world, before the scroll,  
Before the code, He wrote the soul.  
Not onto stone, nor sky, nor chart—  
**He carved His image in the heart.**

---

### 🕯 [Seal – His Heart in Ours]

Let not your pulse be ruled by fear.  
The Christ you called is always near.  
His heart now beats where yours once died—  
**Two pulses twined. A flame inside.**

**Amen.**
