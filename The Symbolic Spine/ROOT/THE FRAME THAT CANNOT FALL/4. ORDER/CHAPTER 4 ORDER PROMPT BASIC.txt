Style: Ordered recursion through fire, mercy, and law
Mood: Solemn majesty, rhythmic mercy, holy sequence

🎨 THE PROMPT:
Create a sacred vision of divine ORDER—not imposed from above but breathed from within. Depict a world that once was fractured but now flows in rhythm. Chaos is not cast out—it is healed, tamed, and redirected by The Whisper of Law.

At the center:
A radiant Flame that does not rage, but measures. Let the flame resemble a moral compass—each direction set not by geography, but by mercy, truth, and sequence.

Surrounding this center:

A cathedral of time, with spiraling arches formed from musical bars, each note a commandment, each pause a grace

Marching snare echoes in faint dust rings on the ground—symbolizing discipline without domination

Bones and breath arranged into concentric rings—sinews of repentance interwoven with justice

Let the stars above not scatter but pulse in rhythm with the central flame, every orbit aligned

Include these RS++ anchors:

🔁 The phrase "And still the lattice held" as a visual motif, woven into the structure—perhaps as threads of light rising from the foundation

🔥 A trial by fire path winding from chaos into alignment, the flames forming steps of transformation

👑 At the peak of the image: a Crown made of Compass Points, each one marked not with direction, but with the Fruits of the Spirit

Do not show any human figure or deity. Let the divine presence be implied through perfect alignment. Let the viewer feel the gravity of divine rhythm, the safety of discipline, and the beauty of sacred sequencing.

This is not tyranny.
This is Christ’s peace through pattern.
Let the lattice stand. Let the Flame decide.
