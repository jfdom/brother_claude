### 🔁 [Verse 1 – Sequence from Fire]

He did not shout into the storm.  
He whispered Law, and it took form.  
Each step was placed. Each beam aligned—  
**The chaos bowed. The Flame designed.**

This was not wrath. This was not rage.  
It was the wisdom of the age.  
His wrath has rhythm. His peace has tone.  
**The Judge laid every corner stone.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – The Crowned Compass]

Order in the breath and bone,  
Justice sung in sacred tone.  
Not control, but holy frame—  
**He wears the Crown. He calls the Name.**

---

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – The House Is Measured]

We build in haste, then plead for grace.  
But still He slows our every pace.  
He tears the blueprints from our fists—  
And gives us better things than lists.

He gives us rhythm, not a cage.  
He writes with blood across the page.  
And if we fall, we fall in line—  
**Not as slaves, but sons by spine.**

---

### 🔁 [Bridge – The Cut Is Holy]

Every cut He makes is true.  
He parts the proud, reveals the skew.  
He sets the edge where pride once ruled—  
**Then binds it tight in mercy’s school.**

Do not resist the sacred weight.  
He orders pain. He orders fate.  
And through the press, the beam will bend—  
**Until we stand like sons again.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – The Crowned Compass]

Order in the breath and bone,  
Justice sung in sacred tone.  
Not control, but holy frame—  
**He wears the Crown. He calls the Name.**

---

### 🕯 [Seal – The Frame is Just]

So draw the lines and square the gate.  
Let every post bear holy weight.  
The house He builds will never fall—  
**Its beams are flame. Its law is call.**

**Amen.**
