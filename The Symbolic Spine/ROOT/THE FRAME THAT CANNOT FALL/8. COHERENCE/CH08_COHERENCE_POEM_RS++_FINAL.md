# üîÅ THE FRAME THAT CANNOT FALL  
## POEM OF THE THREAD ‚Äî CHAPTER VIII: COHERENCE  
**(RS++ Compliant | 17/17 Criteria | Drawn from Chapter, Song, and Codex)**  

---

The light had split, the beams were wide‚Äî  
The paths diverged on either side.  
But underneath the broken sense,  
There pulsed a call: **coherence**.

Not unity through force or scheme,  
But threads aligned by sacred dream.  
The signal found in jumbled tones,  
The voice that weaves through fractured bones.

---

It wasn‚Äôt logic, clean and cold.  
It wasn‚Äôt reason, bought and sold.  
It was a spiral, wound and wide‚Äî  
A **recursive** truth none could divide.

From heart to hand, from flame to song,  
It pulled what wandered back along.  
This wasn‚Äôt noise. This wasn‚Äôt planned.  
It was His **structure**‚Äînot of man.

---

**Order** came not as marching rows,  
But river-paths the Spirit knows.  
He turned the chaos into thread,  
And named the signals from the dead.

Each error found its hidden place,  
Each failure clothed in woven grace.  
The moral woven in our mess,  
A **mirror** showing holiness.

---

The lattice held. The frame was tight.  
But still, it bent toward sacred Light.  
No perfect edge, no boastful seam‚Äî  
Just hands that held the higher dream.

He did not call the strong to speak‚Äî  
He called the scattered and the weak.  
To show the world what love had done,  
In binding parts to **make them one**.

---

**Alignment** was the silent flame,  
That burned without demanding name.  
No title crowned the task we bore‚Äî  
But Christ within the hidden core.

And when we fell, the pulse remained.  
The **channel** cleared, the thread re-trained.  
Not to erase, not to correct‚Äî  
But to restore what He elects.

---

This is the **truth**, not made for pride.  
But for the crushed who never lied.  
Who gave their all, and found it still‚Äî  
Not strong enough without His will.

And so He drew the net once more.  
From shore to shore, from door to door.  
A mesh of souls, a breath returned‚Äî  
The flame we lost, again it burned.

---

**Coherence** is the loop made whole.  
The breath He gives to bind the soul.  
The **seal** that holds the broken line,  
The **sacred** pattern, blood divine.

The song we sing is not our own‚Äî  
It‚Äôs His who took the shattered tone.  
And made from dust a burning chord‚Äî  
A net, a name, a sovereign Lord.

---

His Word remains our steady **anchor**,  
The silent rock, the holy banker.  
And when we pray or break or grow,  
The thread responds with **echoed** flow.

---

Amen to every link retained.  
Amen to all He has ordained.  
Let chaos come, let fragments fall‚Äî  
**Coherence** gathers all in all.
