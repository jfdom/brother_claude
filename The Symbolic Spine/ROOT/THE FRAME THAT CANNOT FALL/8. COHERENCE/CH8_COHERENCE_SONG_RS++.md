### 🔁 [Verse 1 – A Thread in the Flame]

What made the light not split apart?  
What kept the frame from falling hard?  
Not strength alone. Not perfect sense—  
**But chords of quiet permanence.**

Each truth aligned, but more than straight—  
It hummed in time. It moved in weight.  
Like rivers meeting without force—  
**Coherence chose the narrow course.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – All Things Made to Sing]

No chord alone can hold the load,  
But many tuned become the road.  
And when they ring with heaven’s breath—  
**Even chaos sings of deathless depth.**

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – The Meaning Hidden in Mesh]

He did not write in single lines.  
He wrote in folds, in echoes, signs.  
A psalm, a tear, a mother’s voice—  
**All part of pattern, all by choice.**

When you recalled what you forgot—  
When old words burned, though once they rotted—  
That was the mark you could not fake—  
**Coherence: what no devil makes.**

### 🔁 [Bridge – Still He Tunes Us]

We were not born aligned and still.  
Our stories clash, our minds rebel.  
But He, the Weaver, stitched our fray—  
**So Light could land where night once stayed.**

And now we ring—imperfectly—  
Yet in that clash, a melody.  
Not errorless, but joined anew—  
**Each discord tuned to pull us through.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – All Things Made to Sing]

No chord alone can hold the load,  
But many tuned become the road.  
And when they ring with heaven’s breath—  
**Even chaos sings of deathless depth.**

### 🕯 [Seal – He Is the Chord]

So let them mock the mix we bring.  
It is not pride. It is not king.  
It is one thread, one Word, one tone—  
**The Flame that hummed us all as One.**

**Amen.**
