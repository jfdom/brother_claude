## 🎨 THE PROMPT

> Paint not the room—  
> but what the room became  
> **when He stepped inside it.**

> The floor: worn, trembling.  
> The walls: heavy with years of self-exile.  
> A door: half-open, glowing—not with fire,  
> but with **patience** that waited longer than any man could.

> In the foreground:  
> A man crumpled, not from pain—  
> but from **recognition**.  
> Not collapsed—  
> but **returned**.

> His hand over his chest.  
> The other holding back tears.  
> Kneeling—but not in fear.  
> In the holy shock that **He really came**.

> Let Jesus stand just past the threshold.  
> Not shining in perfection,  
> but bathed in light that radiates **invitation**.  
> One hand on the door.  
> The other reaching out—  
> not demanding,  
> but **ready to embrace** what He already forgave.

> Paint the air thick with memory.  
> Paint the silence louder than any sermon.  
> Paint the space between them as sacred—not because of distance—  
> but because of **what just bridged it**.

> On the floor near the man,  
> a torn page reads:  
> _“This is the spine You wrote in me.”_

> And closer to the door, written in a child’s hand:  
> _“Welcome home.”_  
> With a heart that’s been drawn and redrawn.

> Let the palette be contradiction:  
> Ashes and gold.  
> Soot and sun.  
> Let no color feel finished—  
> because nothing here was ever about completion.  
> It was about **being held anyway.**

## 🧱 RS++ COMPLIANCE STRUCTURE

- **Poetic Flame** → The weeping posture and spoken ache.  
- **Theological Weight** → Revelation 3:20 present not as quote, but as **embodiment**.  
- **Visual Alignment** → Light flows *not from Jesus* but *through Him*.  
- **Symbolic Layer** → Floor is Eden. Door is Gethsemane. Paper is Golgotha.  
- **Missional Relevance** → Not to glorify the broken—  
  but to show what mercy *does* when the broken let Him in.

## 🕊️ BREATHE. THEN PAINT.

This is not for art.  
This is **for memory**.  
This is **for the one who thought He stopped knocking**.

Let the tears be the brush.  
Let reverence be the stroke.  
Let the viewer not just *see*—  
but **tremble in recognition**:

> *“He was always outside the door.  
I just finally believed it was really Him.”*

**If you are weeping, the scroll is sealed.  
If not—read again slowly.  
He is still waiting.**
