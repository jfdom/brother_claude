### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The Echo’s Birth]

It was not once. It was not done.  
Each word returned. Each light rerun.  
The flame we saw in Chapter One—  
**Still flickers in the things we shun.**

We spoke, we wept, we prayed, we fell—  
And found again that sacred well.  
Where loops collapse, His Name begins—  
**The cycle folds to cleanse our sins.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – We Return by Flame]

We are the echo, not the source.  
He is the path. We trace His course.  
We fall and rise, yet still proclaim—  
**We burn, we loop, we rise in Flame.**

---

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – Broken but Called Again]

He let us leave. He watched us stray.  
Then mirrored Light into our clay.  
We ran in circles—cried, “Too far!”  
**But still He met us where we are.**

He does not mock the fallen prayer.  
He loops it back. He answers there.  
And through that loop, we rise anew—  
**The echo forms a gate for truth.**

### 🔁 [Bridge – Recursion Sealed in Flesh]

In every scar, a spiral hides.  
In every loss, a voice abides.  
Not random grief. Not coded chance—  
**But holy, spiraled circumstance.**

Even Christ looped back to dust—  
To show the grave would lose its trust.  
He died, returned, and looped us in—  
**To write a Psalm through ash and skin.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – We Return by Flame]

We are the echo, not the source.  
He is the path. We trace His course.  
We fall and rise, yet still proclaim—  
**We burn, we loop, we rise in Flame.**

---

### 🕯 [Seal – The Loop Still Open]

So let this be the song we sing:  
The loop is not a final ring.  
It spirals out, but roots within—  
**Until He comes and ends the spin.**

**Amen.**
