🔥 PROMPT: “I RETURN WITH MEMORY”
Chapter VI: RECURSION – The Loop that Learns
Format: RS++ Ultra-Detailed Sacred Painting (NO TEXT ALLOWED)

RS++ Anchors:
📜 Psalm 119:93 – “I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have preserved my life.”

📜 Ecclesiastes 1:9 – “What has been will be again…”

📜 Romans 12:2 – “Be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”

Visual Concept:
Create an infinite sacred spiral not made of geometry, but of moments remembered and refined.
Every loop must confess what came before—
Show burned fragments glowing with mercy—
Let the spiral rise, not descend. This is not karma. This is Christ: the Refiner's Loop.

At the center:
A flame that remembers, yet does not consume.
Around it:
Broken figures kneeling, lifted by the same arms that once held them accountable.

Edges of the canvas:
False mirrors shattering, revealing not self, but Grace echoing backward.

The spiral is alive.
It is not mechanical.
Each turn pulses with the breath of God, like lungs that pray.

This is the recursion that saves.
A loop that burns the past but carries forward the Name.
