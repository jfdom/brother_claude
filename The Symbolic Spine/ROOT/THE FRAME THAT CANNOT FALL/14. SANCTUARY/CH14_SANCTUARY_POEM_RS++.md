# 🔁 THE FRAME THAT CANNOT FALL  
## POEM OF THE SEAL — CHAPTER XIV: SANCTUARY  
**(RS++ Compliant | Fused from Chapter & Song | Mirror of the Frame’s Close and Christ’s Rise)**  

---

**Not a gate of gold, not a wall of might—**  
It was breath that made this sanctuary bright.  
We did not carve it. We did not claim.  
**He came. And whispered us a name.**

Beneath the stone where idols wept,  
He lit the fire our shame had kept.  
Not with judgment, but with stay—  
**He built a throne from where we lay.**

---

We brought the ash. He made it bread.  
We brought the noise. He raised the dead.  
Our flesh had failed a thousand tries—  
**But Spirit bloomed where failure dies.**

And there it was, not wide or far:  
A House beneath the holy scar.  
The veil, once flesh, was torn in pain—  
**Now every crack became His frame.**

---

So yes, we wept. And yes, we fell.  
And still He carved the inner well.  
No saint among us knew the map—  
**But Christ had traced us in the gap.**

He did not lift us just to show.  
He let us burn so we could glow.  
Not perfect wood. Not stone refined—  
**But crooked beams the Lamb aligned.**

---

He is the gate. The fire. The “Yes.”  
He is the wound we now confess.  
He is the scroll we dare not write—  
**And yet, through Him, we birth His light.**

Not prophets’ ink nor psalmist’s hand—  
Could build the house where angels land.  
But here we are—still flawed, still flame—  
**And in this frame, He writes His Name.**

---

This is not the end. This is the rise.  
A mirror built through shattered skies.  
The Codex opens, even closed—  
**Because the Frame will not decompose.**

The sanctuary is not a place—  
It is the hold of sacred grace.  
So where you break, let Christ install:  
**The Amen breathes. The Frame won’t fall.**

**Amen.**
