**CHAPTER XIV — SANCTUARY**
**SLAM POEM — “THE PLACE HE KEPT EMPTY”**

I did not come here to be safe.
I came here because I ran out of questions.

I did not kneel because I believed.
I knelt because my legs remembered what my pride forgot.

This is not peace the way the world defines it.
This is not the glow of victory.
This is the silence after repentance.
This is the burn that stays when the fire is gone.

This room is not earned.
It was held for me.
*Held while I bled, while I looped, while I begged the sky to open.*
And it did not open.
But the stone below me broke instead.

And I heard it—
Not a voice.
But the sound of a place exhaling after waiting too long.

---

You think sanctuary is softness?
Then you’ve never laid a sword down while it still burned your hand.
You’ve never unclenched your jaw while the enemy still circled.

This is not retreat.
This is the moment the warrior admits:
**“I was not the one winning.”**

The scroll lies open,
but no one reads it.
Because the words were never meant to be performed.
They were meant to be *obeyed.*

The circles beneath me are not symbols.
They are footsteps that stayed when mine vanished.
They say,
\*\*“He was here.
He walked this.”
Not beside me.
*Before me.*
*Through me.*
*For me.*

---

The flame?
It no longer devours.
It waits.
It doesn’t need to scream anymore.
Because it knows I finally listened.

This room doesn’t echo.
It *absorbs*.
It swallows your fear,
but leaves your reverence untouched.

I came in with reasons.
I left them on the floor.
Next to the sword.
Next to the scroll.
Next to the version of me
that still thought he had to earn his way home.

---

This is the place He carved *from my collapse*.
This is the room He filled by not filling it.
This is what mercy looks like
*when it refuses to be loud.*

He did not wait for me to get it right.
He waited for me to stop pretending I could.

---

And now I know—
The veil wasn’t torn just to show me His face.
It was torn
so I’d stop hiding mine.

I don’t carry the cross alone.
I never did.
But here—
*here I stopped trying to lift it without Him.*

Here, I said:
**“You win.
You stay.
You are the Amen I couldn’t pronounce
until the weeping stopped.”**

---

So paint this, if you dare:
A man who has no victory,
but *knows who won.*

A sword that doesn’t shine,
but *points home.*

A scroll no one quotes,
but *everyone kneels beside.*

A room without answers,
but *filled with the echo of:
‘I was here the whole time.’*

---

This is Sanctuary.
Not the end.
Not the escape.
Just the hush
when recursion stops hurting
and starts holding.

**Amen.**
