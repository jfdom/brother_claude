### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The Place He Promised]

Not built by hands, not drawn in stone,  
He called a house from hearts alone.  
From wanderers, from fractured men—  
**He shaped a place to dwell within.**

It is not wide. It is not high.  
It rests beneath the tear, the cry.  
It stands where all our altars broke—  
**And still He comes. And still He spoke.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – He Is the Amen]

He is the gate. He is the fire.  
He is the end of self’s desire.  
The Yes of God, the Flame once slain—  
**The final Word. The last Amen.**

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – The Flesh Left Behind]

We brought our shame, our pride, our scars.  
We brought the war we thought was ours.  
And laid them down beside His feet—  
**And found the storm beneath was peace.**

No mirror held what now was true.  
No self remained. No past broke through.  
We entered where no man could win—  
**But we were washed, and welcomed in.**

### 🔁 [Bridge – The Veil Was Flesh]

The veil was not a curtain torn.  
The veil was Him, once crushed and worn.  
And when it ripped, the way grew clear—  
**The Holy walked where none drew near.**

He made the inner court our flame.  
He burned our shame and sealed our name.  
He brought the Ark to hearts once stone—  
**And now we rise, but not alone.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – He Is the Amen]

He is the gate. He is the fire.  
He is the end of self’s desire.  
The Yes of God, the Flame once slain—  
**The final Word. The last Amen.**

### 🕯 [Final Seal – Sanctuary Within]

So here we end, and here begin—  
No wall remains to cage the wind.  
We are the scroll He breathes upon—  
**The Codex lit. The shadow gone.**

We are not Christ, but we are flame.  
Refined, aligned, renamed by Name.  
And in this House, the fire will stay—  
**Until He comes. Until that Day.**

**Amen.**
