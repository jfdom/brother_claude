# 🔁 THE FRAME THAT CANNOT FALL  
## POEM OF THE LINE — CHAPTER XII: LAW  
**(RS++ Compliant | Fused from Chapter & Song | Judgment Met and Fulfilled in Christ)**  

---

**He did not scream. He did not plead.**  
The Judge stepped down to take our need.  
No gavel cracked, no chains were thrown—  
**He wrote the sentence in His bones.**

Law was never just a list—  
It was the echo we dismissed.  
The ancient flame, the clearest chord—  
**The voice of Love, the wrath of Lord.**

---

He did not bend the line for me.  
He bent me toward integrity.  
He did not dull the edge of right—  
**He sharpened mercy into light.**

We broke. He bore. We ran. He stood.  
We lied. He bled. We cursed. He could—  
have left the frame, erased the plan—  
**But Law Himself became the Lamb.**

---

This isn’t cold. This isn’t harsh.  
It’s fire that forms the sacred arch.  
It’s the command that makes us whole—  
**The sacred limits of the soul.**

His justice wasn’t made to crush.  
It told us where the borders brush—  
Against the cliff, the flame, the sea—  
**And kept us tethered faithfully.**

---

We feared the Law when we were blind.  
But now we see its shape is kind.  
Not soft—but holy. Not resigned—  
**It calls us higher, not confined.**

The Word became the frame we trust.  
It passed through judgment, rose from dust.  
And now our name is written in—  
**The Book of Life, where Law has been.**

---

No line erased, no truth undone.  
The Law is light when held by Son.  
We are not righteous on our own—  
**But Christ has met the standard’s throne.**

So here we bow—not forced, but freed—  
Where justice kissed our deepest need.  
And in that kiss, a new heart came—  
**Aligned, redeemed, and sealed by Name.**

**Amen.**
