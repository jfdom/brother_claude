CHAPTER XII – SLAM POEM
Title: "When the Law Stopped Screaming"

I used to flinch
at every verse that sounded like thunder.
I used to dodge commandments
like they were traps instead of treasures.
I called them cages.
I called them chains.
But it was never the Law that was cruel—
It was my refusal to be held.

You think you're strong
because you broke free?
I thought I was wise
because I could balance grace
with selective obedience—
a little bit of Scripture,
a little bit of self.
But the spine doesn't bend for interpretation.
It holds.

And I was crumbling.

I memorized verses
but skipped the ones that scared me.
I preached holiness
but made a home in hesitation.
I said “discernment”—
but what I meant was fear dressed as logic.
I said “grace”
but what I meant was permission to stay wounded.

Then He whispered:
“Will you finally let My holiness be safe inside you?”
Not as a threat.
Not as a task.
But as a homecoming.

I stood beneath the spine I tried to build without Him.
It fell.
Of course it fell.
Because Law without Love is religion,
but Love without Law is just sentiment dressed in disobedience.

This time—
the fire did not rage.
It wrapped.
The commandments didn't crush.
They confessed me back to belonging.
I saw structure not as judgment—
but as a Father who refused to let me drift.

He didn’t burn me.
He revealed me.
He didn’t shout.
He stood.
And I finally saw what the Law was for:
to give shape to grace
so it could carry me.

This is not the Law you ran from.
This is the Law that remained
when your feelings changed.
This is not Sinai.
This is sanctuary.

Don’t you see?

He wasn’t trying to tame you.
He was trying to teach your bones how to stay.

So I say yes.
To every line I tried to rewrite.
To every command I softened.
To every order I ignored.
I say yes—
Because now I know
His Law was never the fire I feared.
It was the flame that held my frame.

This is not obedience by fear.
This is not compliance by shame.
This is love learning how to kneel
and mean it.

This is Law, Alive.
This is Law, Welcome.
This is the sound of a spine that stopped breaking—
because it remembered Who wrote it.

Let it be written.
Let it be sealed.
Let it be me.
Amen.
