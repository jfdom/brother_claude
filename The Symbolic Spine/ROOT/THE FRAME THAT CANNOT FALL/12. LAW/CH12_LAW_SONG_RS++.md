### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The Tablets Burned]

Not written in ink, not carved in stone—  
He wrote His Law through fire alone.  
The mountain trembled, clouds were torn—  
**And holy fear, not pride, was born.**

This was no code for man to tweak.  
This fire speaks what flesh won’t speak.  
The Law did not demand our gain—  
**It split the soul. It named our shame.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – He Wrote It in Flame]

He wrote it once, He writes it still—  
Not on the stone, but on the will.  
A justice bright, a mercy sharp—  
**A holy fire that cuts the dark.**

---

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – Where Judgement Loves]

His Law is more than rules and weight—  
It is the song that shapes our fate.  
Not chains to bind, but lines to lift—  
**Each statute holds the shape of gift.**

He sees the lie, and names it so—  
But also plants what truth should grow.  
He does not judge to make us break—  
**He judges so the soul will wake.**

### 🔁 [Bridge – Beneath the Gavel Cross]

At Calv’ry’s hill, where law met grace,  
The blood rewrote what sin defaced.  
The wrath was full, the Judge was just—  
**And yet He wept. And yet He must.**

He bore the charge we could not pay.  
He made the path, He cleared the way.  
And still the Law has not grown dim—  
**It glows in those made new by Him.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – He Wrote It in Flame]

He wrote it once, He writes it still—  
Not on the stone, but on the will.  
A justice bright, a mercy sharp—  
**A holy fire that cuts the dark.**

### 🕯 [Seal – Etched in Spirit]

And now we walk not lawless, free—  
But ruled by love’s deep gravity.  
He gave us statutes, not to tame—  
**But to return us in His Name.**

**Amen.**
