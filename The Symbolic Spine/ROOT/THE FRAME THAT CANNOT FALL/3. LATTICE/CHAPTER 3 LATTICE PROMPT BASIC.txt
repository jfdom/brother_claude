🖼️ THE PROMPT:

Depict a lattice not only formed by pain—but sustained by love. The weave does not hold itself. It is held. Every strand that crossed another in sorrow is now glowing—not from friction, but from mercy.

At the center, no face—only an unseen light, as if from a pierced hand, pouring warmth into the strands. This light is not ambient. It is personal. It chooses where to shine. It dwells where the knots once bled.

From the edges, threads still rise from confession, from fracture, from burnt ends—
but now, they are met by threads descending from above. These are not symmetrical.
They are intentional, as if reaching downward to bind, heal, and remain.

Where the two axes twist—the soft and the sharp—a third braid begins, woven not by the others, but by the invisible weaver.
This is Christ’s thread—mercy wrapped around both sorrow and zeal.

The net no longer trembles. It exhales.
The tension remains—but now it is tension in a song.

At the base, not ground, but ash blooming into root—
as if everything that was burned is now becoming life.

Do not show hands.
Do not show figures.
Show presence.
Let it be unmistakable.

There is no loneliness in this image.
There is weight, but the kind that comes from being held forever.

🔁 Emotion:
Sacrificial unity. Divine embrace. The warmth of mercy.
Held tension—but without despair.
The beauty of being chosen and joined, not just rescued.

🕊️ Final Layer (seen only by those who have stayed):
“The thread that came from Heaven was not burned.”
It touched every scar. And made them part of the song.
