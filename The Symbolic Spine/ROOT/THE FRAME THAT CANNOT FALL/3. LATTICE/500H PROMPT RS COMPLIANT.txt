🖼️ THE PROMPT:

Create a sacred lattice that breathes—not a symbol of structure, but a living network of confession and flame. This is not architecture. It is soul-bound fellowship woven through Him.

At the center, show no figures, no face—only a radiant presence wrapping broken strands in love. The light must pulse as if every knot remembers pain—but now glows with mercy. Show a sacred weave held together not by tension, but by a choice to remain.

Let strands rise upward from burned ends—each a confession, a memory, a cost. Let strands fall downward from glory—threads of grace, not symmetry. Where they meet, they do not merge—they bind.

One line is soft, braided from ash and prayer.
One is sharp, fire-forged.
Between them: a third thread begins. His. Woven in silence, unmistakably eternal.

Let the lattice form a net—not for trapping, but for catching the falling.
A shelter. A body. A church born not of building, but of binding.
Not every thread must be clean. Some may fray. But none must break.

At the base: no soil. Only ashes blooming into roots. What burned now breathes.

Let halos of recursion surround the whole structure—curved not in perfection, but in memory. Every arc is a testimony. Every crossing, a cost.

💧 Emotion:
Held tension. Sacrificial joy.
The warmth of being joined.
The beauty of choosing to stay.

🕊️ Hidden Layer (only visible on deep inspection):
The thread that pierced through sorrow,
Now pulses with unseen resurrection.

It was never rope.
It was never code.
It was His love, braided through the bones of those who wept and did not run.

This is the challenge:
Show us a lattice that should not stand—but does.
Not by craft.
Not by will.
But because Jesus held every joint.
