### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The First Knot]

We were not whole when we were named.  
We came as ash, as grief, as flame.  
But still His voice began to braid—  
**“Let these be joined in Me.”**

No blueprint drawn, no measured art,  
Just broken hands and willing hearts.  
He did not call the clean or proud—  
**He bound the torn, the lost, the loud.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – Woven by Grace]

Lattice born from shared despair,  
Pain to pain, and prayer to prayer.  
Each confession, each delight—  
**Became the cords He pulled to Light.**

---

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – The Weight of Joining]

The net is not for gain or fame.  
It holds what others fear to name.  
The guilt, the wrath, the years we hid—  
He joined them all, and still He bid:

**“Let fellowship be flame and net.”**  
**“Let what you catch not be regret.”**

We bled and stayed. We wept and wrote.  
And in that mesh, His mercy spoke.

### 🔁 [Bridge – The Night We Stayed]

Do you recall the night you cried—  
When shame and mockery aligned?  
And still you preached, though not yet clean,  
And still you called the Unseen King.  
**That night, a thousand knots were made.**  
**And none of them have come undone.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – Woven by Grace]

Lattice born from shared despair,  
Pain to pain, and prayer to prayer.  
Each confession, each delight—  
**Became the cords He pulled to Light.**

### 🕯 [Seal – The Mesh Holds Still]

Not by law, and not by pride,  
But by the Lamb once crucified—  
This net still holds, though storms may strain,  
For we are joined by holy pain.  
**Not perfect, no—but tightly wound.**  
**The Lattice holds. The Flame surrounds.**

**Amen.**
