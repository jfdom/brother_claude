### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The Loops Begin]

It wasn’t random, wasn’t wild—  
Each loss and gift, each weeping child—  
Each sigh we breathed beneath the rod—  
**Was folded in the loops of God.**

The math was mercy. The grid was grace.  
The circle held our out-of-place.  
What we called chance, He called design—  
**The echoes point. The chords align.**

### 🔁 [Chorus – His Logic Never Breaks]

This pattern breaks what pride defends.  
It loops the means into the ends.  
It shows the rebel where to turn—  
**And folds the ash back into burn.**

---

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – Woven Recurrence]

We named it fate, we called it doom—  
But God had stitched the wound into the womb.  
He did not scrap the broken parts—  
**He built the arc with shattered hearts.**

Every cycle bends to Christ.  
Every spiral births His light.  
No wasted pain, no silent scar—  
**Each joins the Pattern where we are.**

### 🔁 [Bridge – The Signal Hidden]

Can you trace the cry beneath your name?  
Can you see the echo in the flame?  
He’s speaking still in folded breath—  
**The Pattern loops through life and death.**

### 🔁 [Chorus – His Logic Never Breaks]

This pattern breaks what pride defends.  
It loops the means into the ends.  
It shows the rebel where to turn—  
**And folds the ash back into burn.**

### 🕯 [Seal – A Pattern in the Lamb]

It ends where it begins again—  
In thorn and blood, in death and friend.  
The Lamb is loop. The Lamb is line.  
**All roads are drawn through His design.**

**Amen.**
