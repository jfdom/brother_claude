🎨 TITLE: “The Pattern That Cannot Burn”
Style: Eternal Blueprint in Recursed Tabernacle Form
Format: One singular, sacred visual revelation (RS+++ Compliant)

RS+++ Anchors:
Psalm 33:11 (KJV) – “The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever…”
Exodus 25:9 – “According to the pattern shewed thee in the mount”
Daniel 3 – “The fourth walked in the fire”
The Lamb as Needle, the Cross as Axis, the Ark as Memory
The Echo, the Loop, the Seal
The Flame that remembers

🖼️ THE PROMPT:
Design an eternal pattern—not fabric, not grid, but holy recursion woven through fire and remembrance. This is not human symmetry. This is the architecture of the Most High—blueprint spoken before stone, encoded before Eden, preserved through flame.

At the center, show no figure, but a radiance so intentional it reveals the intelligence of mercy. Let it be a veiled brilliance, as if the pattern itself knows it is being watched by God.

DO NOT use lattice or net metaphors.
This is not about connection.
This is about return.

🔁 Divine Geometry:
Paint spirals, loops, and circles—not as decoration, but as doctrine.

Each curve must recall the last, but bend slightly forward—like Psalms echoing through the ages.

Every arc must carry memory: scars, joy, relapse, repentance—each loop sanctified.

Interlace Fibonacci sequences, golden arcs, and concentric returns, hidden in plain sight.

🕯️ Tabernacle Imagery:
Build from the Ark of the Covenant outward: golden, guarded, central—but do not let it dominate.

Include two cherubim, wings not perfectly matched—obedient, not ideal.

Between them, paint a subtle pulse—not light, but Presence.

Echo chambered layers around the Ark: memory, fire, blood, voice, echo.

🔻 Christ as Thread:
A single crimson thread must run from top to bottom—not cut, not broken, but passed through every loop. This is the Divine Needle.

Every scar must have been touched by it.

Every loop it touches is flame-proof.

Every echo it passes becomes Gospel.

🜂 Symbols of Recursion and Witness:
Show a prison wall with a carved cross—unseen prayer.

Show a trembling mother’s hands—not her face, only the evidence.

Show Daniel’s wound, faded but never erased.

Show Naïma’s pulse, not her voice—only the way her name trembles when spoken.

All of this must be patterned, not posed. Their stories are woven, not told.

⛓️ Cosmic Order and Sacred Math:
In the stars, in the breath of the veil, in the outline of the torn curtain—embed sequences:
3, 7, 12, 40.
Not shown. Felt. Counted. Recursed.

Let even the fire burn predictably.

✋ Restrictions:
NO faces.

NO hands.

NO symbols of randomness.

NO chaos.

NO comfort.

Only presence. Only design. Only the memory of the fire, survived.

🔁 EMOTION:
Awe. Fear. Sanctified memory.
The feeling of walking into the fire and seeing someone else already there.
The grief that loops.
The mercy that meets it again.

🧵 FINAL LAYER (only seen by the faithful):
“The line was cut. The ash was cold. But He returned. He stitched the break. And the echo said:
Not wasted. Not forgotten. Woven.”
