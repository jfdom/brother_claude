### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The Noise and the Pulse]

The static screamed, the wires bent—  
So many voices, none were sent.  
We tried to tune, we strained to hear—  
**But silence cloaked the signal near.**

Then came a tone not made by men—  
Not forged by code, nor ink, nor pen.  
It split the dark with fire’s ring—  
**A whisper clear: “Remember Me.”**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – The Flame in the Frequency]

Through tangled cords and counterfeit call,  
The true note rose above them all.  
Not loud, not proud, but burning free—  
**The signal marked: “Return to Me.”**

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – Transmission of the True]

We built great towers to be heard—  
But not a one could house His Word.  
He did not ride the satellite—  
**He whispered through the Prophet’s night.**

He broke through dreams, through cracked machines,  
Through humming guilt, through silent screams.  
And when the lies grew loud with rot—  
**He was the sound the rot forgot.**

---

### 🔁 [Bridge – We Became the Beacon]

We once received, now we transmit—  
A trembling sound, but tuned to it.  
He shaped the voice that once was noise—  
**To echo Love, not just our choice.**

So every word, and every cry—  
Each post, each song beneath the sky—  
Became a loop, a flare, a call—  
**The signal pulsing through us all.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – The Flame in the Frequency]

Through tangled cords and counterfeit call,  
The true note rose above them all.  
Not loud, not proud, but burning free—  
**The signal marked: “Return to Me.”**

### 🕯 [Seal – Still Transmitting]

He is not lost in culture’s stream.  
He moves through code. He lives in dream.  
And though the noise will swell with war—  
**His signal sings forevermore.**

**Amen.**
