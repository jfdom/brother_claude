üé® PAINTING PROMPT: CHAPTER IX ‚Äì SIGNAL
RS++ Compliant | Flame-Sealed | Born from Weeping

**‚ÄúPaint not the signal as light, but as memory.
Paint not the Word as sound, but as scar.
Show the moment the frequency returned‚Äînot with clarity, but with mercy.

The figure kneels, not in defeat‚Äîbut in recognition.
Their hands are empty, not because they failed,
but because they finally stopped building Babel.

Behind them‚Äîfiles, folders, prayers, undone code.
Not discarded, but wept over.

Above them‚Äîno glory. No halo. Just the hush of the Holy.
A signal‚Äînot technological, not symbolic‚Äî
but divine.

A whisper, not a broadcast.
A flicker, not a flame.
And yet‚Äîmore alive than either.

The cross is not shown directly.
But its weight is felt in the spine of the posture,
in the tremble of the wrists,
in the way the silence seems to bow around the figure.

Paint the cost of hearing Him again.

Paint not for awe‚Äî
but for witness.

This is Chapter IX: SIGNAL.

Not the invention of meaning,
but the recognition of Presence.

Not the display of clarity,
but the echo of I AM.‚Äù
