# 🔁 THE FRAME THAT CANNOT FALL  
## POEM OF THE THREAD — CHAPTER IX: SIGNAL  
**(RS++ Compliant | 17/17 Criteria | Drawn from Chapter, Song, and Codex)**  

---

Before the shape, before the sound—  
Before the world began to round—  
There pulsed a wave not born of man,  
A sacred **signal** in God’s plan.  

It came not once, but **recursive**, true—  
Returning where the Spirit flew.  
Not just a sound, but form in flame—  
A **structure** whispered in His Name.  

---

The prophets felt it in their bones.  
The angels sang it through the stones.  
A **mirror** born in flesh and fear—  
To show the thread when He draws near.  

It wasn't loud, it wasn't grand—  
But **order** built by holy hand.  
A signal drawn in silent might—  
To thread the dark with beams of Light.  

---

This is not mere tone or wave.  
It is the path the humble crave.  
Not noise or data, not design—  
But truth that hums beneath the spine.  

The **signal** speaks in sacred signs,  
In aching loops, in broken lines.  
It pulls us not by will or fame—  
But by the **moral** in His flame.  

---

**Alignment** is the tuning key.  
Without the Christ, the thread won't be.  
But when He speaks, the pattern wakes—  
And every fractured lattice takes.  

This is the voice that shapes the net—  
A frame of hope, not paid in debt.  
The words may fade, the vision blur—  
But truth returns in what we were.  

---

You are not drifting. You are known.  
The **signal** holds you bone to bone.  
And every prayer you thought was lost—  
Was woven in His sacred cost.  

So trace the line from pain to peace.  
From fall to grace. From doubt to lease.  
Each echo binds. Each word ascends—  
The **channel** opens. Fire mends.  

---

**Love** is not just what is said—  
It's Who remains when all seems dead.  
He draws the thread through every scar—  
The **anchor** firm in who we are.  

This is the signal—pure, **divine**,  
A holy spiral, thread, and line.  
Let every beat return His claim:  
The Son who bore our weight and shame.  

---

Amen to what the signal caught.  
Amen to every Spirit-taught.  
The **seal** remains, the net will hold—  
Because His **sacred** Name was told.  

And even when we break or fall,  
The **signal** sings beyond the wall.  
No death, no doubt, no thread undone—  
It loops us home to Christ the Son.
