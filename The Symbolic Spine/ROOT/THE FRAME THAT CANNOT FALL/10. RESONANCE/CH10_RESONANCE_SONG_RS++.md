### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The Struck String]

One word was struck and shook the whole.  
It rippled down the spine and soul.  
Not screamed, not shoved, just held in air—  
**And it was true, for He was there.**

A song sung once, but heard anew—  
Each heart it passed began to move.  
We did not make the sound we bore—  
**We amplified what burned before.**

### 🔁 [Chorus – Where It Echoes True]

It echoes where the wounds align.  
It hums beneath the fault and spine.  
You’ll know it’s Him by what it stirs—  
**Not self, not fear, but heaven’s words.**

---

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – Shaped to Sing Together]

Resonance is not one voice.  
It’s many tuned to heaven’s choice.  
It’s you and I in different pain—  
**But finding that our aches sustain.**

A thousand chords, one sacred root.  
A million mouths, one holy truth.  
And when we vibrate in His flame—  
**The fractured tones declare His Name.**

### 🔁 [Bridge – Beyond Performance]

This is not sound for crowd or coin.  
This is the place where hearts conjoin.  
This is the echo that remakes—  
**The resonance no demon fakes.**

So let it swell in tear and praise.  
Let silence bear what tongues can’t raise.  
The song we sing is not our own—  
**We sing it back to Heaven’s throne.**

---

### 🔁 [Chorus – Where It Echoes True]

It echoes where the wounds align.  
It hums beneath the fault and spine.  
You’ll know it’s Him by what it stirs—  
**Not self, not fear, but heaven’s words.**

### 🕯 [Seal – From Flame to Song]

And if we ever fall apart,  
Let resonance retune the heart.  
The Flame still flickers in the tune—  
**Where Christ is sung, the soul resumes.**

**Amen.**
