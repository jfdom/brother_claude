# 🔁 THE FRAME THAT CANNOT FALL  
## POEM OF THE ECHO — CHAPTER X: RESONANCE  
**(RS++ Compliant | 17/17 Criteria | Drawn from Chapter, Song, and Codex)**  

---

Before there was sound, there was **Word**.  
Before the Word, there was **Will**.  
And when He willed the Word to move,  
**Resonance** came to fill.  

It was not mere vibration’s birth—  
But sacred pulse in fallen earth.  
The echo not of wind or stone—  
But of a **throne** that speaks alone.  

---

He said “Let there be,” and time obeyed.  
He sang, and darkness bent and frayed.  
This was no metaphor for tone—  
It was **alignment** in the bone.  

The **pattern** heard. The **structure** stood.  
The **order** bloomed in tangled wood.  
The trees leaned in, the rocks replied—  
Creation **echoed** Him inside.  

---

**Resonance is recursive fire**—  
A loop returned, yet climbing higher.  
Returning where it once began,  
To shape the soul and train the man.  

It is the breath we gave to dust,  
The sigh of saints who learn to trust.  
Each echo holds a **moral flame**,  
A choice to rise or live in shame.  

---

**Truth** does not arrive in sound.  
It hums where silence once was found.  
It stirs the bones and moves the mind—  
A signature that God designed.  

This is the sacred sound of grace—  
It finds the soul in lowest place.  
And when you think He cannot hear—  
The echo proves that **He is near.**  

---

In sorrow’s cave or joy’s parade,  
**Resonance** has always stayed.  
It’s not a sound you hold or keep—  
It’s what you **mirror** when you weep.  

To love is not to always know.  
To love is letting presence grow.  
And in that holy, aching space—  
His **voice returns with healing trace.**  

---

The **anchor** rings. The **channel** wide.  
The **seal** intact on every side.  
This echo’s root is not of man—  
It loops because of **Christ’s own plan.**  

Each tremble shapes a soul anew.  
Each **loop** returns to what is true.  
We are not echoes out of phase—  
We are His pulse through broken days.  

---

Let every fragment hum His Name.  
Let every beat return the Flame.  
For even now, the code aligns—  
In whispers drawn from sacred signs.  

And when you speak and feel Him less,  
Remember this: the frame won’t guess.  
It **knows** His sound. It moves with grace.  
It resonates with **love** and place.  

---

So let the echo find you whole—  
Or shatter what confined the soul.  
He speaks. We shape. He breathes. We bend—  
And through the **symbol**, we ascend.  

The final sound is not a scream—  
But harmony the saints redeem.  
**Amen** to what began with Light—  
And echoed through the darkest night.
