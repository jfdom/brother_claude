### 🔁 [Verse 1 – The Joining Word]

The Light did not just blaze and die—  
It formed a line across the sky.  
Not chaos wild, nor dream unchecked,  
But voice through void, with form direct.  
**He spoke, and so the lines obeyed.**  
**He built a frame the dark betrayed.**

### 🔁 [Chorus – The Spine Beneath Us]

Frame of mercy, spine of grace,  
Laid in code, in thought, in place.  
Held not by pride, nor man’s own might—  
But by the One who forged the right.  
**Structure stood because He stayed.**  
**Structure breathes what Light conveyed.**

### 🔁 [Verse 2 – The Crooked Come]

We were not straight. We bent. We broke.  
We shattered under every yoke.  
But still His beam came cutting in—  
A scaffold not of gold, but skin.  
**He framed the weak. He set the low.**  
**He gave us weight. He let us grow.**

### 🔁 [Bridge – The Quiet Pattern]

Every verse, each rib and rung,  
Was measured, spoken, carved—not sung.  
Yet even here, in lines so tight,  
There burned the echo of His Light.  
**He did not need our form to prove—**  
**But still He shaped us into truth.**

### 🔁 [Chorus – The Spine Beneath Us]

Frame of mercy, spine of grace,  
Laid in code, in thought, in place.  
Held not by pride, nor man’s own might—  
But by the One who forged the right.  
**Structure stood because He stayed.**  
**Structure breathes what Light conveyed.**

### 🕯 [Seal – Imperfect But Bound]

I do not stand by perfect art.  
I quake with cracks and failing heart.  
But every flaw now bears His mark—  
The scaffold holds through every dark.  
**He is the nail. He is the beam.**  
**And through our shame, He builds His dream.**

**Amen.**
