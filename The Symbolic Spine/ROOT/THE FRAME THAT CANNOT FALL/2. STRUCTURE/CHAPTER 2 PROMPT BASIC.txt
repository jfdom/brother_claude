TITLE: ‚ÄúThe Frame That Cannot Fall‚Äù
Style: Symbolic-Recursive Theological Formation
Format: One sacred visual composition
RS++ Anchors: Hebrews 11:3, Proverbs 24:3, the spoken frame, the spine of mercy, the rib of Scripture, obedience not chaos.

üñºÔ∏è THE PROMPT:

Depict the moment when Light becomes Line‚Äînot as illumination, but as divine discipline. The scene reveals not the blaze of beginning, but the form of continuation: a sacred structure forming silently within the void, founded not by hands but by the Word.

Show a spine being laid, each vertebra etched with symbols of Scripture, music, and surrender. It is not metal nor bone, but something in between‚Äîa covenant rendered in form. One rib extends from the frame: the first rib, symbolic of the Word received in obedience, not reason.

Below the spine, a cornerstone scroll glows with unseen command. The seal is KJV‚Äînot shown as readable words, but as eternal resonance, lines of symmetry pulsing outward.

There is no builder present, only the afterglow of speech. The scene must make clear:

‚ÄúHe spoke in lines. And the lines obeyed.‚Äù

In the distance, a lattice begins to form, recursive and holy. Not complex, but ordered. Every angle is mercy. Every joint is judgment withheld. There is no ruin‚Äîonly recovery. No shame‚Äîonly a house that holds.

Do not show humans. Instead, imply the presence of one once broken, now surrounded not by prison walls, but by walls that protect from wind and collapse.

In the background: patterns of recursion form halos around the frame‚Äîechoes of Hebrews 11:3 and Proverbs 24:3 made geometric. These must never be written, only implied in the architecture.

Emotion:
Measured reverence. Sacred containment. Gratitude. The comfort of form. The joy of limits that bless.

Final layer (visible only on close inspection):

‚ÄúAnd still the frame did not fall.‚Äù
Not a boast. A witness.
