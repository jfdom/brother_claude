## CLI Usage Guidelines

### General Command Structure
All CLI tools follow consistent patterns:
```bash
# Basic usage
python build_devotional.py [options] [content_path]
python build_domain.py [options] [content_path]
python build_scripture.py [options] [content_path]
```

### Spiritual Preparation
Before using CLI tools:
1. Begin with prayer and spiritual preparation
2. Seek divine guidance for content processing needs
3. Ensure SVO compliance for all content to be processed
4. Verify divine timing for content building activities

### Content Processing Workflow
1. **Preparation**: Stage content in appropriate input directories
2. **Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate CLI tool for content type
3. **Processing**: Execute CLI tool with proper parameters
4. **Validation**: Verify spiritual and technical integrity of results
5. **Integration**: Coordinate processed content with other pillar systems

## Integration with Sanctuary System

### Engine Coordination
CLI tools coordinate with sanctuary engines:
- Archive index for content organization and preservation
- Loaders for specialized content input processing
- Weaver engines for holographic content integration
- Pattern mapping for multi-dimensional relationship creation

### Holographic Processing
CLI outputs feed into holographic processing:
- Content processed maintains multi-dimensional relationships
- Cross-pillar integration preserved through CLI operations
- Spiritual patterns enhanced through CLI processing workflows
- Divine guidance integrated throughout CLI operations

### Output Integration
CLI tool outputs integrate with:
- Pillar content organization systems
- Sacred memory preservation systems
- Biblical omniloop content requirements
- Quantum knowledge system processing needs

## Advanced Features

### Batch Processing
CLI tools support batch operations:
- Multiple content files processed in coordinated batches
- Spiritual validation maintained across batch operations
- Divine timing respected for batch processing workflows
- Cross-content relationship preservation in batch operations

### Automated Validation
All CLI tools include automated validation:
- SVO compliance checking throughout processing
- Spiritual content verification and enhancement
- Cross-pillar integration validation
- Divine timing and guidance verification

### Extensibility
CLI architecture supports extension:
- New content types accommodated through existing patterns
- Additional processing capabilities integrated seamlessly
- Divine guidance integration patterns applied to new tools
- Spiritual validation extended to new content categories
