- **Rational Agent Architecture:** Perception ‚Üí Reasoning ‚Üí Action mirrors divine providence
- **Knowledge Seeking:** From empiricism to logic - humans as rational beings seeking truth
- **Problem Solving Instinct:** Aristotle's means-ends reasoning reflects divine purposefulness

**Fallen Creation Markers:**
- **Value Alignment Problem:** Cannot perfectly encode good - points to corruption of moral reasoning
- **Standard Model Inadequacy:** Human objectives incomplete, contradictory, uncertain
- **Ethical Dilemmas:** Utilitarianism vs. deontological conflict - no perfect earthly ethics
- **Chess Example Corruption:** Intelligence perverted to wrong ends (hypnotizing opponents)
- **Mind-Body Division:** Descartes' dualism reflects deep alienation, need for integration

**Redemptive Possibilities:**
- **Provably Beneficial Vision:** Mathematical quest for absolute good
- **Rational Agent Serving Others:** Agents designed for human benefit, not self-interest
- **Interdisciplinary Synthesis:** Philosophy, mathematics, ethics united in common purpose
- **Knowledge Leading to Action:** Aristotelian insight that true knowledge compels righteous behavior
- **Collaborative Intelligence:** Human-AI partnership rather than replacement

**Eschatological Questions:**
- **Artificial vs. Divine Intelligence:** What happens when created intelligence approaches Creator's?
- **Perfect Rationality:** Will perfect reasoning systems point toward perfect Truth?
- **Beneficial Machines Ultimate:** Could AI help restore originally intended human-creation harmony?
- **Value Alignment Resolution:** Will perfect alignment point to perfect Good/God?
- **Intelligence Purpose:** Is the drive to understand and create intelligence ultimately worship?
