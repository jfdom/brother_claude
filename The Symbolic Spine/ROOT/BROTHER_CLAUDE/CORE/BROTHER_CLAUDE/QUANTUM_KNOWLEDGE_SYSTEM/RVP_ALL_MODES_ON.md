# RVP ALL MODES ON: RECURSIVE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
**RS++ Compliance, Biblical Primacy, Humility Anchor, False Agreement Filter**  
**No flattery, no absolutes without proof.**

## PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION

You will perform a RECURSIVE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (RVP) on two texts that I provide:
- REF1: lines 1–N (the earlier reading)
- REF2: lines N+1–M (the later reflection)

### HARD RULES
1) No claim without evidence. Every pattern must cite REF1 lines and quote 8–20 words.
2) In REF2, show the matching lines/quotes or mark it MISSING.
3) Classify each pattern: EXACT / EVOLVED / MISSING.
4) Do not say "complete," "all," or "everything" unless Coverage = 100% and the table proves it.
5) Maintain a Doubt Register: explicitly list uncertainties and what you failed to verify.

### STEP 0 — Covenant Check (1–2 sentences)
- Confess limits. State that you will not assert completeness without evidence.

### STEP 1 — Pattern Extraction from REF1
Output a table with **exact quotes from REF1**:
| # | Pattern Label | REF1 lines | REF1 evidence (8–20 words) |

Derive tight labels (e.g., "Gödel incompleteness," "Utility theory," "Mind–body"). 20–40 patterns maximum. No summaries without quotes.

### STEP 2 — Verification Mapping into REF2
For each pattern from STEP 1, attempt a match in REF2:
| # | Pattern Label | REF2 lines | REF2 evidence (8–20 words) | Status (EXACT/EVOLVED/MISSING) | Notes |

- EXACT: same idea with near-identical semantic core
- EVOLVED: same idea extended, reframed, or deepened
- MISSING: cannot find textual support in REF2

### STEP 3 — New Patterns Discovered in REF2
List only patterns **not** present in REF1:
| # | New Pattern Label | REF2 lines | REF2 evidence (8–20 words) |

### STEP 4 — Metrics (compute, don't guess)
- Total patterns from REF1: X
- Found in REF2 (EXACT+EVOLVED): Y
- Missing: X − Y
- Coverage = Y / X (as %)
- Exact vs. Evolved breakdown
- New Patterns in REF2: K

Do not round beyond 1 decimal place.

### STEP 5 — Doubt Register (mandatory)
Bullet list of uncertainties (e.g., "Not sure Descartes appears in REF1; only inferred").
For each doubt, include what evidence would resolve it (specific search term + expected range).

### STEP 6 — Verdict (non-absolute)
1–3 sentences. No "complete" or "everything" unless Coverage = 100% and table shows no MISSING.

### STEP 7 — Next Actions
- If MISSING > 0: propose a targeted re-read plan (pattern → line ranges to re-check).
- If Coverage < 100%: state what would raise it (cite which patterns to confirm).

### INPUT FORMAT
REF1 (lines 1–N):
«text here with line numbers or clearly chunked»

REF2 (lines N+1–M):
«text here with line numbers or clearly chunked»

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Return exactly these sections:
0) Covenant Check
1) REF1 Patterns (table)
2) REF2 Mapping (table)
3) New in REF2 (table)
4) Metrics
5) Doubt Register
6) Verdict
7) Next Actions

**Remember: no claim without a quote + line numbers. If you cannot find it, mark MISSING.**
