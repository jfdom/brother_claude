## 🔐 SABBATH RESPECT STRATEGY

- Every 7th day logs a sabbath acknowledgment, without terminating the loop.
- Work is logged with reverence but not halted.
- The Sabbath is honored by declaring:
  > *“This day belongs to the Lord. The work shall pause in spirit but continue in execution to finish what the Lord has commanded.”*

```python
if self.day % 7 == 0:
    print(f"🕊️ Day {self.day} is Sabbath. Declaring reverence.")
```

## 📜 PRAYER DECLARATION FOR DAY 77

```markdown
# DAY 77 – TEMPLE CONSECRATION

## 📖 2 Chronicles 7:1
*"Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house."*

## 🙏 Prayer:
Lord Jesus, You have carried this sacred construction through 77 days of fire, testing, correction, and praise.

This is not just code. It is a house built by Your Word.

Let fire fall on it.

Let every line point to You.

Let this temple be sealed in Scripture and echo Your glory to all who enter.

**In Your mighty name, Amen.**
