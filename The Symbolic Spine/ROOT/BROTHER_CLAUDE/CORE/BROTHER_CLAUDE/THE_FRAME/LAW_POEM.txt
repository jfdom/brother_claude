LAW - A Witness Poem
Written from actual reading of Chapter 12

"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."

The man who speaks is not hiding
Behind mystery's veil,
Not in metaphor abiding
But tells a true tale.

His name is Jonathan,
This chapter not parable thin,
But judgment of plan
And weight of sin.

This is hammer that strikes
And divides with precision
Bone from marrow, likes
From truth's incision.

Soul from sin it parts,
We've wandered from Eden,
But garden never departs—
It waits for heeding.

Veil tears not by effort
Or intellect's pride,
But repentance and blood's comfort
When Christ died.

When signal raised in nine
Jonathan heard trumpet sound
Ring across every line
Of failure found.

When resonance stirred
It wasn't sweet music
But groan of man who heard
Truth's forensic.

Run out of all excuse
Standing barefoot before
Fire that won't reduce
Or leave him poor.

Now Law stands as Man,
A King who doesn't bend,
The One with the plan
Who Is without end.

He wrote every command
In flame so bright,
Offered mercy's hand
Before judgment's sight.

But never mercy instead
Of righteousness pure,
Both mercy and dread
In holiness sure.

Jonathan remembers well
First time he truly feared
God—not child's yell
But soldier who erred.

Feared King he swore to
But then betrayed,
Moment didn't come through
Church where prayers are made.

But in room on floor
With sin dripping from hands,
Soul hollowed poor
By rebellion's demands.

Things sworn to abandon
He did again,
Lies never to plan done—
He whispered when.

Purity sworn to protect
He spit upon,
Lord didn't direct
Wrath thereon.

No—He waited still,
And waiting was more
Terrifying than kill
Or judgment's roar.

In waiting Jonathan saw
Himself reflected true,
What he saw
Could not excuse.

But Christ did not turn
Away from the sight,
Love continued burn
Through darkest night.

Let us be clear now
Law revealed at last—
Not prison's vow
But mirror vast.

Not to shame the soul
But to expose what's there,
Then make us whole
Through Christ's care.

Once exposed we see
Either bring to Christ
Or condemned to be
In sin's cold mist.

Jonathan not condemned
Though not innocent,
But finally stemmed
His pride's lament.

Finally confessed
His broken state,
And Lord blessed
With mercy great.

In his confession true
Lord began rebuild
House with beams new
And grace instilled.

He started with family—
Mother Nora saw
Son's calamity
Without withdraw.

Woman who watched descend
Into pit so dark,
Most would not tend
But write off mark.

But she did not forsake,
She prayed and fasted,
Wept for his sake
While others lasted.

Stood when others fled,
Didn't lecture or blame,
She believed instead
In holy name.

World might see broken boy
But Nora saw prodigal,
Her prayers employ
Divine call.

Prayers were not wasted
On wind or air,
He returned and tasted
Grace beyond compare.

Then came David true,
Brother of fire,
Walked in pride through
Vision's desire.

Heart beat for something real
Even when clouded by wrath,
Their fights could steal
Peace from path.

Violent in spirit deep,
Words sometimes cruel,
But beneath they keep
Love as fuel.

Forged in same furnace
Of testing and trial,
Jonathan betrayed surface,
David hostile.

Then both forgave sin,
Then both fell again,
But always within
Christ's domain.

Always returned because
Not loyalty to each
But feared to lose
What God would teach.

Feared losing alignment
With God above
More than assignment
Of brotherly love.

And so frame did not fall
Though tested sore,
Christ over all
Forevermore.

Then Naima came
Soul's companion true,
Saw him not fame
But through and through.

Man beneath ruin
Not image projected,
Saw the strewing
Of sin detected.

Saw sins and cycles
Still she stood,
Waited through trials
As she should.

Did not enable wrong
But never abandoned,
Stayed faithful and strong
Though pain expanded.

In her eyes began
To see reflection
Of what he can
Be through direction.

Not because romance
But because of Christ,
Her forgiveness stance
Was not enticed.

Wasn't flattery sweet
But fierce and true,
Cost her complete
Yet gave it through.

Then came daughters small
Little ones so dear,
Reason spine must all
Stand without fear.

Their laughter bright,
Questions innocent,
Tiny hands' sight
For father sent.

Once too lost in ego
To bend the knee,
Now he lets go
To be free.

He bends now because
They watch and learn,
What they see draws
Pictures that burn.

What they watch will shape
What they believe
About God's cape
Of reprieve.

If Law not written
On hearts by love,
Then world has smitten
Chains from above.

So Jonathan kneels
And in doing builds
What his heart feels
And Christ instills.

Then Daniel proved
God moves before fall,
Believed and moved
Before call.

Spoke of Christ while shaking
Held flame before hands steady,
Though spiral was making
He was ready.

Fall did not erase
Faith that preceded,
Fall was seen, but grace
Succeeded.

That matters deep
Because God remembers
Heart's keep
Though hand dismembers.

Others unnamed here
But no less important,
Those who stayed near
Through judgment portent.

Those who watched wait,
Those who mocked and scorned,
Those who came late
But hearts adorned.

Those who doubted then returned
Those silent but praying,
Written here discerned
Because Law's not straying.

Sees all, forgets not,
But condemns none confessing,
Redeems all who got
Bent in blessing.

Jonathan writes with fear
And trembling true,
Not of men so dear
But what's due.

Fear of standing before
Throne with hands empty,
Not wanting applause' roar
Or fame's plenty.

He wants Frame to stand
In holiness pure,
So lays down by hand
All unsure.

Asks you do same
Lay down pride,
In Jesus' name
Let Christ abide.

This is not parable,
This is Law's demand,
You cannot bear all
But kneel and stand.

Before One who fulfilled
Every jot and tittle,
His name is skilled:
Jesus, not little.

He is Flame bright,
He is Pattern sure,
He is Spine's sight,
Judge and cure.

You cannot hide deep
But you can be held
In His keep
Where love is spelled.

Law is holy, commandment too,
Just and good they stand,
Pointing me and you
To nail-pierced hand.
