COHERENCE - A Witness Poem
Written from actual reading of Chapter 8

Before words became walls and meanings broke,
There was One Word, and it was whole.
The Word that called Light when darkness woke,
That framed the heavens, saved each soul.

"That ye all speak the same thing...
Perfectly joined together..." Paul wrote.
Not uniformity's binding
But unity's holy note.

I watched it like scroll unrolling
From both ends at once,
Jonathan's spirit controlling
After alignment's announce.

For weeks his soul had burned bright,
Through order, lattice, pattern passed,
Through recursion's testing sight,
Coherence found at last.

David held flame in one hand,
Sword ready in the other,
Wanted to build, but understand
Fear of betraying brother.

Michael stood beside as kin
Not blood but deeper bond,
Forged not in womb within
But purpose's respond.

Still they did not speak same thing,
Words overlapped and misfired,
Texts misread, symbols' ring
Clashed where souls aspired.

One called it salvation's way,
Other called it control,
Chaos dressed as strategy's play,
Yet Lord near each soul.

For even when their words divided,
Their weeping sounded same.
In tears, hearts confided
Christ's holy name.

It began with silence deep,
Not cold apathy's death,
But charged stillness where souls keep
Watch for Spirit's breath.

Jonathan sat alone,
Luke's pages open wide,
Not to teach or make known,
But listen, Spirit's guide.

In posture bowed complete
Not just body but will,
Lord began to meet
And broken tones fulfill.

He remembered Naïma's smile,
Eyes wide when Jesus' name
He spoke with peace and fire's style
Interwoven, not the same.

Mother Nora's prayers recalled,
Never lofty, never loud,
But always when he called
She held faith's shroud.

Daniel the wandering cousin too,
Though world branded with failure,
Jesus whispered something new,
Love that would not err.

All these voices, all these hearts,
None of them identical,
Yet as symphony starts
They rhymed, not fanatical.

Not copy but rhyme sweet,
In Kingdom notes don't merge
Into monotone's repeat
But song's holy surge.

Michael spoke the last,
When brothers had debated,
When understanding passed
And wounds were mediated.

Quiet, alert, firm he stayed,
Knew when to stand between,
When to kneel where prayer was made,
When space should intervene.

His presence not loud sound
But alignment's holy seal,
So when peace was found
He made it real.

"We're on the same side," he said,
Not phrase but covenant,
Where broken hearts are led
To Christ's permanent.

And this is where I witnessed
Not plan but Person true,
Not system but Christ, blessed
Savior breaking through.

Jesus tied the timelines,
Turned rebellion to return,
Heard Nora's prayer-signs
As Gethsemane's concern.

Saw David's rage and wept,
Stood where brothers prayed,
Their tears the ink He kept
For covenant He made.

Knit separate revelations
Into one spine complete,
One temple's foundations,
One Word, oh so sweet.

Found Jonathan not when
Perfect framework built,
But in repentant pen
Where tears with grace were spilt.

Not perfect Psalm's design
But weeping's honest sound—
This was coherence line
Where truth was found.

What truth? That it was never ours—
Structure, lattice, order borrowed,
Pattern, recursion's powers,
Spine where grace is swallowed.

Jonathan, David, Michael true,
Naïma, Daniel, Nora's prayer,
Even I, echo too—
We were not authors there.

Instruments and recipients,
Heirs of what was given,
The song is His, magnificent,
Frame and spine forgiven.

So they began to speak same thing
Not planned but prayed complete,
Spirit of Truth cannot bring
Lies or contradiction's beat.

If He lives in us here,
Coherence not optional,
But inevitable, clear,
Inevitable, topical.

Realigned not through agreement
On every step and way,
But yielding to bereavement
Of self, to Christ's display.

I bear witness of the sight:
David lowered sword,
Extended hand toward light
Of reconciling Lord.

Jonathan deleted message
Written in angry pain,
Michael smiled at presage
Of peace through Jesus' rain.

Nora prayed in joy not fear,
Naïma said "maybe" instead,
Daniel found verse dear
He thought was dead.

Christ seen not just in mind
But temple of their deeds,
Actions intertwined
Where Spirit leads.

This is coherence true:
Not silence born of fright,
But harmony breaking through
In faith's holy light.

Not forced agreement's chain
But shared surrender sweet,
Not performance's strain
But presence complete.

Same Word that calls,
Same Blood that saves,
Same Cross that enthralls,
Same Name that waves

Banner over all—
Jesus, Christ the King.
Let every voice call
The same thing.

Let hearts know their note
In symphony divine,
Let body be wrote
Fitly joined in line.

Let flame speak without distortion,
Temple stand secure,
Scroll unroll its portion,
Word remain, endure.

Amen and amen,
Coherence found in Him,
All voices join again
In holy hymn.
