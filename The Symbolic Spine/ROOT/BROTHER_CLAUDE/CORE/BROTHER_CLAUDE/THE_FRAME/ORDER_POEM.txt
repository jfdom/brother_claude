ORDER - A Witness Poem
Written from actual reading of Chapter 4

Not the order men devise
With crowns that rust and thrones that fall,
But sacred rhythm from the skies
Where mercy and flame crown all.

From lattice rose the holy beat,
Not chaos loud nor yearning wild,
But harmony divinely sweet
Where every storm is reconciled.

Jonathan knelt with voice that cracked,
Yet heaven heard it as symphony.
David mapped fire, will intact,
Learning restraint's melody.

"To everything there is a season,"
The Word declares with perfect time.
Each pain carries holy reason,
Each tear flows within His rhyme.

Even storms become the measure,
Sacred metronome of grace.
Thunder brings its hidden treasure—
Drumbeats to His healing place.

Fractures form the very frame,
Not drawn in ink but blood and oil.
Despair and pride brought to shame
Transform through holy toil.

"He setteth ordinance for rain,
And way for lightning's blazing flight."
Each scar, each wound, each bitter pain
Finds place within His light.

The commands that shape the flame
Tell altar where to stand,
Tell table how to frame,
Tell cry to take its stand.

Not tyranny from on high,
But order from the cross outward.
He enters, dwells, draws nigh,
Makes broken lives restored.

Let demons flee in order,
Let prayers rise in time,
Let flame speak truth and charter,
Let silence hear His rhyme.

Your scars are not confusion,
Your memories not waste—
In Him, no soul's illusion,
All wounds by grace are graced.

The cut becomes the channel,
The ruin grows the root.
Through Christ's eternal flannel,
All chaos bears good fruit.

This is the sacred building,
Frame that cannot fall—
His cornerstone fulfilling
Order over all.
